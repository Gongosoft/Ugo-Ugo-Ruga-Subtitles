1
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,933
We do control.

2
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:08,160
It's morning.

3
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:09,785
Are you both hungry?

4
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:10,026
Hungry.

5
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:10,969
Hungry.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,474
Hungry?

7
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:14,841
If there's cake and daifuku here,

8
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:16,648
What will you do?

9
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:16,769
Cake!

10
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:17,813
What about you, Ugo-go?

11
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:19,379
I love cake!

12
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:21,588
Then I'll tell you what I'm going to say today.

13
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,190
Okay.

14
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:22,571
Okay.

15
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:24,780
Those who follow the will never follow the will.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,368
What?

17
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,138
The cake and the... Say it again.

18
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:31,294
The two big things don't make one big thing.

19
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:32,241
Nitto!

20
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:33,752
Nitto!

21
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:34,659
Koumono!

22
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:35,928
Koumono!

23
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:36,492
Nitto omoezu.

24
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,598
I don't think so.

25
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:44,997
If you're too greedy to eat cake and daifuku, you'll get a stomachache and won't be able to eat either.

26
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:47,265
Do you remember?

27
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:47,466
Yes.

28
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,095
Well, today, we had a good time.

29
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:51,741
We had a good time.

30
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:52,323
We had a good time.

31
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,046
Well done.

32
00:01:56,637 --> 00:02:00,910
Kero kero kaede desu!

33
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:17,278
Koto no Hakubu-san!

34
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,584
You know what?

35
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:10,962
Yo!

36
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:16,375
I heard it's good to drink warm milk when you can't sleep.

37
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:25,344
Here we go!

38
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:25,786
Uwogoruga!

39
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:26,871
Uwogoruga!

40
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,201
I'm in trouble.

41
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:44,655
I was invited to a date.

42
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,791
What should I do?

43
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,112
It's too early.

44
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,987
I wonder?

45
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,937
It's a good song, isn't it?

46
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,706
I'm getting nervous.

47
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:56,470
My theme song.

48
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,241
Do you remember?

49
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,224
Yes!

50
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,632
Do you want to sing and be moved?

51
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:04,996
Yes!

52
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,460
Do you want to?

53
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,323
Then, I'll sing a special song for you.

54
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:10,846
It's okay to sing.

55
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,737
3, 2, 1.

56
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:23,622
You're about to cry, aren't you?

57
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:34,202
Today's job is a nail artist.

58
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,473
My job is a nail artist.

59
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:43,095
I take care of my hands and feet, and help with the fashion of my nails.

60
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,630
Adults sometimes put makeup on their nails.

61
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:54,333
Long nails are thin and look beautiful.

62
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:58,452
The nail artist is the one who does the makeup as you like.

63
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:03,127
It's important to put your hands in front of the makeup.

64
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:09,387
The nail artist will peel off the thin skin of the nail to make it easier to put on makeup.

65
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:14,241
Use special scissors to carefully peel it off.

66
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,951
It doesn't hurt at all.

67
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,498
Put makeup nails on the real nails.

68
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:35,863
Nail artist paints magic clay with special powder on nails.

69
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:47,102
When the magic clay hardens, as you can see, real long nails are made.

70
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:49,938
Wonderful!

71
00:05:52,583 --> 00:06:02,323
Let's ask the nail artist to show us his special skill He will make a hole in the nail and paint it with red paint

72
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:10,795
If you put the real diamond in the nail hole, the nail will look rich.

73
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:19,941
This is the job of a male artist

74
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:42,790
In front of the man I like, in front of the man I like, in front of the man I like, in front of the man I like, in front of the man I like, in front of the man I like, in front of the man I like,

75
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,408
This is so weird!

76
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:48,552
Super weird!

77
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,781
So weird!

78
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:52,206
I'm gonna get hated!

79
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,181
I can do it!

80
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,181
It's sad.

81
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,671
But, you know, my face is a little big.

82
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,954
I can't help it.

83
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:03,175
You...

84
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:07,292
Do you think so?

85
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:07,453
Yes!

86
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:09,200
I knew it!

87
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,574
Then I have no choice but to do my best even if I have to endure it!

88
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,100
Asano Bun-gaku Minami Kaikisen Daikai

89
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,672
In a town called Brooklyn, there was a child of a poor tailor.

90
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,222
His name was Henry Miller.

91
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:34,045
Miller was a poor boy who had never been loved by his mother.

92
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,553
So he always wanted to be loved by someone.

93
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:44,383
One day, Miller decided to give courage to a girl he fell in love with for the first time in his life.

94
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,953
Oh, I like you.

95
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,805
Please go out with me.

96
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:50,427
I don't want to.

97
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,002
Pillar's first love ended with a one-sided love.

98
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:54,323
Next!

99
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:59,694
A day on the side of justice.

100
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:04,515
In the morning, the neighborhood patrol continues.

101
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:11,364
It's a very embarrassing worry.

102
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,698
It's embarrassing to be asked by Kougo-kun.

103
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:18,534
How many times do I have to ask you?

104
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,027
Ugao-kun, can you cover your ears for me?

105
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:28,109
Yuga, will you listen to me?

106
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:28,209
Yes.

107
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,093
When I'm sleeping at night,

108
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:37,817
It seems that the seeds are blowing out from the inside of the body.

109
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:45,494
What do you think I should do to stop crying?

110
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:45,736
I'm tired.

111
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:46,660
Are you kidding?

112
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,773
Good morning.

113
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,816
Junko Kiyokawa!

114
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,345
Let's make flowers!

115
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's make a bracelet with flowers today.

116
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,858
Flower Bracelet

117
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:14,991
We have ribbons, pochkis and flowers.

118
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:18,823
Ribbons, pochkis and flowers.

119
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:26,535
First, prepare a ribbon that is slightly longer than the length of your wrist.

120
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,644
Then, cut the stems of the flowers.

121
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,875
Put a flower on the ribbon and fasten it with a hotchkiss.

122
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:44,170
At this time, I think it's good to fasten it firmly in two places.

123
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:48,948
Stop with a hotchkiss.

124
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:51,983
When you stop a flower, the hotchkiss

125
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:58,003
At the base of the flower, hide the bottom of the flower and put the next flower on it.

126
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,408
Put the flowers on top of each other.

127
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,842
You can add some leaves between the flowers.

128
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:09,328
Repeat this for a long time.

129
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,136
And then...

130
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:16,418
At the end, leave the length of the ribbon to tie the ribbon.

131
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:23,843
If you make it longer, you can make a headdress or a neck ornament.

132
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:37,426
I'll bite your nose!

133
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,095
Kakuya?

134
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,848
If I bite your nose, won't you die?

135
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:50,462
I always put my nose in when I go to bed.

136
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:50,623
Really?

137
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:56,883
Don't cry, you'll be fine.

138
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:57,806
Yeah, but I'll die.

139
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:01,879
If you do that, you won't be able to come here from next week.

140
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,026
What's that?

141
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:05,832
I'm doing it.

142
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:06,695
Are you okay?

143
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:10,367
Can you forgive me?

144
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:14,333
Right.

145
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:15,498
I see.

146
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,071
I can live like this again today.

147
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,697
Well then, bye-bye!

148
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:20,998
Bye-bye!

149
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,335
When you're eating at the hairpin...

150
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,105
Uga Uga Uga Uga Uga

151
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:49,812
Who are you?

152
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,038
Hi!

153
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,888
I'm Kanemochi's son.

154
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:53,652
Are you all eating?

155
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:09,250
I wonder when they'll stop crying.

156
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,484
I don't know.

157
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:16,362
Today, I'm going to teach you Japanese, as a thank you for being with me today.

158
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:18,793
It's the correct Japanese.

159
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:18,913
Okay!

160
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:21,124
What do you say when you say, Father?

161
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:21,888
Father!

162
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:23,697
Oh, good job, good job.

163
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:27,435
Then, what do you say when you say, Father?

164
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,462
It's a reward.

165
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:30,426
Oh, that's great.

166
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,570
Ugo Ugo is very good at it.

167
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,600
Be careful when you use polite words.

168
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:35,383
Okay.

169
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,847
Have a great day!

170
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:37,132
Bye!

171
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:37,965
Bye!

00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:47,550

Eat your food and evolve
