1
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:02,940
Hoho, it's a good morning again today.

2
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,774
The TV seems to be in a good mood, so I'd like to laugh, but how about the three of us try laughing?

3
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:07,915
No!

4
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:09,981
Would you like to try laughing?

5
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,858
Ready, set, go!

6
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:18,692
Today's word is...

7
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:19,836
Laugh!

8
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:25,000
If you live a happy life, you will be happy.

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,196
Today, let's have fun and laugh together.

10
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,912
Have fun!

11
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:31,716
Have fun!

12
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:32,239
Have fun!

13
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,211
Who are you?

14
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,367
Good morning.

15
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,434
I'm a high school girl.

16
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:42,837
How are you?

17
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,885
To-to-to-to-to-to

18
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,202
What's up, sir?

19
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:59,027
Hey, I heard that a glass of water in the morning will make your poop come out better.

20
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,545
Ready, set, go!

21
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:30,297
Last week, it was a chicken, but today we are reborn.

22
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,512
Moshinobu Dadabuhi!

23
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,431
Did you get it, you two?

24
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:36,176
I got it!

25
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:36,760
Alright!

26
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:43,808
Lots of work to do!

27
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:45,132
That's right!

28
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,239
Today's work is a gyoza craftsman.

29
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:52,490
My job is to make gyoza.

30
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,662
I'm a gyoza craftsman.

31
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:57,364
This is a gyoza.

32
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:03,270
To make delicious gyoza, the skin of the gyoza is important.

33
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:13,693
He's cutting one dumpling now.

34
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,522
He's using a fork to make it round.

35
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,757
Gyoza craftsmen are very skillful.

36
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:24,600
No matter how many they make, they are all the same size.

37
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:29,871
Excellent!

38
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:32,025
This is the inside of the dumpling.

39
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:41,155
Gyoza craftsmen can make various kinds of gyoza, such as vegetables, meat, and shrimp.

40
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:46,755
No matter how fast you are, it won't stick out.

41
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:51,718
If you are a gyoza craftsman, you can make a flower-shaped gyoza.

42
00:04:56,086 --> 00:05:01,455
The gyoza craftsman knows how to wrap the skin of the gyoza.

43
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,822
Great!

44
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:08,496
This is Ryoza's job.

45
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,045
Amazing!

46
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,183
If Luga-chan kisses you, what are you going to do?

47
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:26,835
That's weird.

48
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,861
What should we do?

49
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,672
Ruga-chan said it's fine.

50
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:33,013
It's fine?

51
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,439
Ruga-chan, do you want to go?

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,186
No, I don't want to.

53
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,230
Ruga-chan, why don't you go?

54
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,945
Good day.

55
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,712
Good day?

56
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:44,203
Why?

57
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,413
Good.

58
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:46,714
Really?

59
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:50,236
Asano Bun-gaku!

60
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,363
Minami Kaikisen, the third episode!

61
00:05:54,541 --> 00:06:00,121
Eventually, Miller started working at a New York telecom company.

62
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,252
But people at the same workplace didn't like him at all.

63
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:09,012
However, there was only one thing I was looking forward to in the future.

64
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:13,005
It was to write a novel about how people at the same workplace failed and were scolded.

65
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,279
Okay, now I'm going to draw the part where he gets mad at me.

66
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,553
Here I go!

67
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:26,497
A day on the side of justice.

68
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:26,859
Lunch.

69
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,822
It's good!

70
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,897
Kame-Ginba!

71
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:33,550
If the school is gone, what will you two do all day?

72
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,482
I'm playing.

73
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,053
Playing?

74
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:39,692
What are you playing?

75
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:44,229
Chirin.

76
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,668
Shiritori.

77
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,180
Shiritori.

78
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,290
Ho, ho, ho.

79
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,436
Shiritori.

80
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,003
I want to play outside.

81
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,335
What do you want to play outside?

82
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:57,925
Nawa-tobi.

83
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,535
Nawa-tobi, huh?

84
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,483
What about you, Ugo-go?

85
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,330
I'll study at home.

86
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,062
What's wrong with her?

87
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:10,337
She'll be in trouble if she loses her school.

88
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:19,737
Because if I become a father, if I don't study enough, I can't be a father.

89
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,331
Oh, that's interesting.

90
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,875
Yo!

91
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:31,938
Good morning.

92
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:45,606
Today, let's make a simple bouquet.

93
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:53,790
What you need is a flower, a string, and a ribbon.

94
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:03,409
First, cut each flower into the same stem length.

95
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:12,701
If there is a leaf in the center of the flower stem, please remove it.

96
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,593
Remove the leaf.

97
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:24,199
First, take a flower and add another flower around it.

98
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,527
At this time, try not to line up the same flowers as much as possible.

99
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:41,479
You can make a cute bouquet if you make the big flowers low and the small flowers a little higher.

100
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,171
Lower the large flower and raise the small flower.

101
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:51,385
Once you have a bouquet of flowers with all the flowers, tie it with a string and tie it.

102
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:55,172
Tie the middle with a string.

103
00:09:55,192 --> 00:10:01,932
I'm going to put a ribbon on this string, but if it's a normal ribbon knot, it won't be able to take a pretty shape.

104
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:09,492
In this case, first attach a knot to the string with a ribbon.

105
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:14,466
And make two rings with another ribbon.

106
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:18,958
Let's tie this other ribbon with the first ribbon.

107
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,021
You can also make a large bouquet in this way.

108
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:37,707
What if there's no more rice in this world?

109
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,454
What if it's just bread?

110
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:40,558
That's fine.

111
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:41,301
Is that fine?

112
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:42,887
No!

113
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:43,470
No?

114
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:47,566
You don't like it?

115
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:47,646
No.

116
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,518
Why is that, Ugo Ugo-kun?

117
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:52,766
It's me, right?

118
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:54,818
I don't like it either.

119
00:10:55,203 --> 00:11:00,524
Wow, it's like a YouTube channel.

120
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,569
But the food is...

121
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,894
I can't hear you.

122
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:03,677
But the food...

123
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:06,071
All you have to do is have food.

124
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,027
Wow, that's great.

125
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:12,607
What do you think, Gogo-kun?

126
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:15,719
I'm going to run a restaurant.

127
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,667
You're running a restaurant?

128
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:21,626
I can't do it without rice.

129
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:24,298
I can't eat without rice.

130
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,800
I see, so the conclusion is that you can't live without it?

131
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:28,686
That's right!

132
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:35,674
Speaking of food, I'm a little hungry.

133
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,398
I'm going home soon.

134
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,825
Let's meet again next week!

135
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:40,692
Yeah!

136
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:41,236
See you!

137
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:41,719
Bye bye!

138
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,102
Bye bye!

139
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:52,125
When I was training in the straight end, I got hit by Senna.

140
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:14,147
I'm an alien, puang puang puang puang puang

141
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,853
Did you like today's video?

142
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:36,417
Yes, I did.

143
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:39,257
Was it fun?

144
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:39,358
Yes.

145
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,365
Let me tell you the truth.

146
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,495
This is the correct Japanese for TV.

147
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,910
How do you count the white squids in the sea?

148
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,374
What?

149
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,101
How do you count a squid?

150
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:53,704
One?

151
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:54,086
What?

152
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:54,869
One.

153
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,315
Correct.

154
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,545
One times two.

155
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:03,270
Just like the juice in the cup, you have to count one and two.

156
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:04,114
Okay.

157
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:04,817
Did you get it?

158
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Yes!

159
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,789
Then let's count a few more days today.

160
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:08,994
See you later!

161
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,560
Bye-bye!

162
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:26,608
Thank you for watching

163
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,325
Thank you for watching

164
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:48,107
Go!

165
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:04,044
Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka.

166
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,370
Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kachi.

167
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,901
The father of the twins and Takashi Porado

168
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:21,435
Eat rice and evolve.
