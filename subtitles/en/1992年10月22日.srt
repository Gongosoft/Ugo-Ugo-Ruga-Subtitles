1
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:15,696
Mint.

2
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:44,348
Oh no, they're both upside down.

3
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,209
Good morning.

4
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,872
Good morning.

5
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:05,919
I picked up a dunghill this morning.

6
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,725
Have you ever picked up a dunghill?

7
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:08,327
Yes.

8
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:08,648
Where?

9
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:11,660
It's my backyard park.

10
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,993
I see, I see.

11
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,923
Have you ever picked it up, Ruga?

12
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,828
I have!

13
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:17,250
You have?

14
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,592
Where?

15
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:22,502
I don't know.

16
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:26,470
Today's word is Don Guri no Seikurabe.

17
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,522
Don Guri no Seikurabe.

18
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,591
Don Guri no Seikurabe.

19
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,695
Yes, yes.

20
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,442
Donguri has the same height.

21
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:37,676
Well, it's used when there's no difference between the two.

22
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:42,617
Well then, today as well, donguri, korokoro, okiraku, gokuraku!

23
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:47,565
Donkuri, korokoro, okiroku, gokuroku!

24
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:47,967
Well done!

25
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:54,552
Who is it?

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,783
Yes!

27
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:57,015
Commander!

28
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,125
I'm coming with you!

29
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,292
To-no-ha-gu-bu-ta-gu!

30
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:14,265
When your lips are dry, it's good to apply honey.

31
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:18,553
Set, go!

32
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:38,517
Hi, Aeon.

33
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,147
I came again this week.

34
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,999
You didn't take any of my requests.

35
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,896
Since then, I've been thinking about it day and night.

36
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,421
Look, I've made so many bears.

37
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,424
Do you know what a bear is?

38
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:57,351
It's not like there's a bear hanging under your eyes.

39
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:58,455
No, it's not.

40
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,980
There's a black line like this.

41
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,717
Good job!

42
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:02,682
Alright!

43
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,275
You're looking good today!

44
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,662
I've got a lot of work to do!

45
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:07,506
That's right!

46
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,786
Today's guest is a kitchen artist.

47
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:18,745
I am a kitchen artist.

48
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:25,832
He looks like a cook, but his job is not to cook.

49
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:32,807
This is his work tool.

50
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:37,341
His job is to make various things from the styrofoam.

51
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:42,943
To cut it well, you need this hand-made cutter.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,824
It's hard to cut a wrinkled part.

53
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:55,667
But the kitchen artist can easily cut such a part.

54
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:01,263
Great job!

55
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:06,366
Use this knife to carve out the details like a sculpture.

56
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:15,008
It's starting to take shape.

57
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:15,871
It's a big crab decoration.

58
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,537
Hey, good job!

59
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:24,047
This was all made from the steam roll.

60
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,670
Kitchen artist's work is in the restaurant and party venue.

61
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,957
to make a big ornament.

62
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:36,488
With what he has made, it will be fun to eat.

63
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:47,378
This is the job of a kitchen artist!

64
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:47,659
Amazing!

65
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,228
Let's start with Chibi.

66
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,670
It's Robot-kun's funny story!

67
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:08,423
No.

68
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:08,824
1.

69
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:14,243
Even if an elephant is an elephant, what is the elephant inside the body?

70
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:14,624
A dead elephant!

71
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,009
A dead elephant!

72
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:17,169
What?

73
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, you got it right away.

74
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,383
That's good.

75
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:30,325
Oh, but there's a lot of things like a little knee, right?

76
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,597
Then this question was a bad question.

77
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,854
That's not true.

78
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,542
Is it funny?

79
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,271
I got it!

80
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,377
I got it!

81
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,689
You didn't get it, did you?

82
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,071
Is it funny?

83
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:45,574
Is it funny?

84
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:51,597
Okay, now that we're all ready, let's go to the next one.

85
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,590
Okay!

86
00:06:54,262 --> 00:07:00,542
Asano Bun-gaku Minamika Exhibition 4

87
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:07,024
One day, Miller met a cute girl with a little mysterious beauty at the usual store.

88
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:08,008
I'm Miller.

89
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:08,830
What's your name?

90
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,195
It's Mara.

91
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:14,752
I wanted to meet someone like you.

92
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,076
Will you come to my house?

93
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:18,987
The two became close friends and spent the night together.

94
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,487
You are very warm.

95
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:26,530
After that, Mira and Mara spent the night together many times.

96
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:36,520
Milan is in the same bed as Mara, and it makes me feel so happy that my heart is pounding and I can fly up in the sky.

97
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,017
A day of a righteous ally.

98
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:42,983
In the afternoon, a monster settles down.

99
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:56,733
What kind of pencil do girls hate?

100
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:59,022
Pencils girls hate?

101
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,714
Um... Pencil?

102
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,861
I don't know.

103
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,948
What is it?

104
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:13,149
The answer is a pencil.

105
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,230
Ah!

106
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,446
Good morning.

107
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:30,256
Good morning.

108
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,742
Mr. Junko Miyokawa.

109
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,659
Let's make it with flowers!

110
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,072
Let's decorate the cake with flowers today.

111
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:40,534
Flower cake!

112
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:48,280
I think it's very cute to decorate it with a cake for your birthday or Christmas.

113
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,080
The ingredients are flowers, toothpicks, and aluminum foil.

114
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,156
Aluminum foil, toothpicks, and flowers.

115
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:03,640
First, leave a little bit of the stem and cut it.

116
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,977
Put a toothpick on the stem.

117
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:13,086
Let's wrap it with aluminum foil Wrap it with aluminum foil

118
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:18,891
Here are some flowers.

119
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:23,765
Then, place the flowers side by side on the cake.

120
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:28,138
Place the flowers side by side.

121
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:36,525
If you use a small flower, you can draw a letter on top of the cake.

122
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:46,515
I think it's cute to put water in a bowl and let the flowers float.

123
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,220
Nice.

124
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,901
I'm doing pretty good today, right?

125
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:00,083
Yeah!

126
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:06,350
I was always losing confidence because I was always showing my lower body.

127
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:07,675
That's right.

128
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,482
It's good to go like this.

129
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,647
This time...

130
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:21,755
But it's not good to have a lot of answers.

131
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:22,037
What?

132
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:31,909
I've got a lot of questions with answers this time, so this mystery is also an angel with sweet nails.

133
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,323
Did you get it?

134
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:36,094
I have no idea.

135
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:44,447
When I don't get it, it gets messy.

136
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:48,980
Well, I'm going to go to bed.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,109
I'm so tired that I can't sleep.

138
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,072
See you later!

139
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:53,593
Bye-bye!

140
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:05,254
She's dancing with a ball in her skin.

141
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:18,045
Ugaa Ugaa Ugaa Ugaa

142
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,433
Who are you?

143
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,069
Yes, I am Ojiizo.

144
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,832
What did you think of today's mystery-telling, Robot-kun?

145
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:54,388
It was fun, wasn't it?

146
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,312
Yes, yes.

147
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:56,537
Both of your mystery-telling was really good.

148
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:00,930
Teach me the correct Japanese for the reward.

149
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,271
Okay!

150
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,100
What do you say when you say, you can eat?

151
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:04,922
You can eat.

152
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:06,527
Or, you can eat.

153
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:07,692
I can eat it!

154
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,399
That's right, Orico Orico!

155
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,187
I can eat it!

156
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,252
You can eat it!

157
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:13,477
You can definitely eat it!

158
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:14,863
You can eat it!

159
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,232
Tabe-ra-re-ru.

160
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,517
Tabe-ra-re-ru.

161
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:21,441
Remember that.

162
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,892
Tabe-re-ru means hot pot or hot pot.

163
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:28,145
My mouth is dirty, so my mouth is clean.

164
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,068
That's right.

165
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:29,830
Well, that's good.

166
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,472
Well, that's good.

167
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:30,993
Well, that's good.

168
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:31,515
Well, that's good.

169
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:32,097
Well, that's good.

170
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:32,839
Well, that's good.

171
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:33,882
Well, that's good.

172
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:35,300
Bye!

173
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:08,138
At first, it's round and round

174
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:19,630
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:29,805
Eat your food and evolve
