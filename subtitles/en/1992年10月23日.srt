1
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:01,670
Phew.

2
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,336
Today's TV show was about to fail.

3
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,284
Have you both failed?

4
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:05,545
Yes.

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,155
What kind of failure?

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,825
Well...

7
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,201
Hurry up and say it.

8
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,043
I spilled the egg.

9
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:16,544
That's a failure.

10
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:21,878
Today's phrase is, Failure is the mother of success.

11
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:27,437
Failure is the mother of success.

12
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:27,999
Very good.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,889
If you fail a lot, you will succeed a lot someday.

14
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:31,753
Yes.

15
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:33,140
Did you remember?

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,502
Yes!

17
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:37,280
Well then, have fun today!

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,722
Have fun!

19
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:38,245
Have fun!

20
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:38,466
Well done!

21
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,346
Who are you?

22
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,190
Hello, I'm Emi Murai.

23
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,027
Oto no Hakubutsu-tan!

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,990
One, two, three.

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,495
It seems that if you put the finished teabag on your eyelids, you can get rid of the fatigue in your eyes.

26
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,993
One, two, three!

27
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:15,194
Uoguruga!

28
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:15,897
Uoguruga!

29
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:16,982
Uoguruga!

30
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,244
It won't be hard.

31
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:29,841
Who are you guys?

32
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,967
I'm scared.

33
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,500
Are you Ugo Ugo and Luger?

34
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:36,962
Yes.

35
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,030
It's a horn!

36
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,095
Oh, I see.

37
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:44,914
I thought it was different because horns are popular.

38
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:45,195
Full of work!

39
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,159
That's right!

40
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,027
Today's work is a shamisen craftsman.

41
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:57,392
My job is to make a instrument called a shamisen.

42
00:03:57,412 --> 00:04:00,874
I am a shamisen craftsman.

43
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:07,455
Shamisen is an instrument made of three strings that have been in Japan for a long time.

44
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:15,100
The important thing to make a paper ship is to make a good river.

45
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,773
If you hold it with your feet and rub it hard, you can make a leather that is easy to handle.

46
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:29,538
The Shami-sen craftsman can tell if a good sound comes out just by looking at the face.

47
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:30,321
No, it's a success!

48
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:35,804
This is a seaweed made from rice.

49
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:40,767
It's been used for decades, so it's very strong.

50
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:54,402
He quickly hooks a thread on a tool like a large washing tweezers and sticks it on the skin.

51
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:59,353
Mr. Chami-sen doesn't let his guard down.

52
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,890
Well done!

53
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:10,450
Whether the sound is good or not is decided by the tension of the skin of the shamisen.

54
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:15,782
Shami-sen craftsman checks if it's well-dried and makes it.

55
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,621
I made a good-sounding shami-sen Great job!

56
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:29,253
This is the work of a Kamisen craftsman.

57
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:29,434
Amazing!

58
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:45,887
Then I heard that you guys are good at various things.

59
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,443
Sochi is...

60
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:52,081
It depends on where you listen to it.

61
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:54,872
It depends on where you listen to it.

62
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:55,154
What?

63
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:55,776
Sochi...

64
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,397
What do you think?

65
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,365
It's good.

66
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,530
Oh, really?

67
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:06,129
Can you teach me how to do it?

68
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,076
I put my hand in the gap.

69
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,588
I take it with my hand and put it in the net.

70
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:14,397
It's too fast, I don't get it.

71
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,223
What kind of gap is that?

72
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:20,276
Well, it's like this.

73
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:21,139
Well...

74
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,823
It's a gap.

75
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,550
That was fast, but you don't get it?

76
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:34,067
Maybe you've never caught a crayfish before?

77
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:34,690
I have!

78
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,261
Are you mad?

79
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:39,111
I knew it!

80
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:42,832
Asano Bungaku!

81
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,527
Minami Kaikisen!

82
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:46,030
Saishoukai!

83
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,910
On a cold night with beautiful stars, Mira and Mara were warming up their cold bodies in the bed.

84
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,880
However, their happiness did not last long.

85
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,618
Miller, who hated Mara, said goodbye to her.

86
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:09,744
However, while remembering that happy feeling, Miller strongly thought in his heart that he would do his best even if he was alone.

87
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,410
The End

88
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,747
One day as an ally of Sein.

89
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,737
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,

90
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,916
Is there anything you're good at?

91
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:27,529
Do you like movies?

92
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,971
Well... Dance?

93
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:33,531
Are you good at dancing?

94
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:37,371
Can you teach me how to dance well?

95
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,342
Do you shake your hips?

96
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,068
No, I shake my butt.

97
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:43,834
You shake your butt?

98
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:49,308
No, it's not.

99
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:53,065
Let's dance.

100
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:56,592
Don't shake your hips too much.

101
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,337
I see.

102
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:01,266
I have limited movement, so I can't go that far.

103
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:05,940
But I have a sense of rhythm.

104
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,061
Well, I'll have to practice.

105
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:12,589
Good!

106
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,975
Good morning.

107
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:24,199
Good morning.

108
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:29,692
Let's make it with flowers!

109
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:30,679
Today, let's make poplis.

110
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:42,863
Popri is a dried flower, and it has a very nice scent when it is in the room.

111
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:49,748
For example, I think it would be good to make it with the flowers when the flowers are wilted.

112
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,200
What we have here are flowers and aluminum foil.

113
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,443
Aluminum foil and flowers.

114
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:06,370
First, arrange the flowers and petals on the aluminum foil.

115
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,868
Arrange flowers and petals on aluminum foil.

116
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,925
Put this aluminum foil in the oven.

117
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:19,289
If it's a petal, 2 to 3 hours.

118
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,401
If it's a flower, 4 to 5 hours.

119
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:29,151
Dry at a temperature of about 60 to 70 degrees Dry in the oven

120
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:34,118
When you use an oven, ask your mother to use it with you.

121
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,993
Let's ask your mother to help us.

122
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:46,147
When it's done, put this pot in a bowl and sprinkle with your mother's perfume.

123
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,097
I think it will be very fragrant.

124
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:04,352
Then, the language of my country, well, this is a country in the west,

125
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:08,295
I will give you the word of the word.

126
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,825
Please teach me.

127
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:10,791
Is that okay?

128
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:11,355
Yes.

129
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:21,632
It's not just a word, but in our country, we call it OOKINI.

130
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,775
OOKINI!

131
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:29,135
Well, it's a pretty good line, but it's a bit emotional.

132
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,103
Try saying it like you're really grateful.

133
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:31,605
OOKINI!

134
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,297
I like it!

135
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,231
It's good, isn't it?

136
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:37,748
The language of my country is beautiful.

137
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,656
Not at all.

138
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,022
We're more beautiful.

139
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:42,730
What do you mean?

140
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,352
Say it.

141
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:43,975
Well...

142
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,814
What does it mean?

143
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,204
Thank you.

144
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:50,607
Thank you.

145
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:59,618
When I say I like it, it's as if I'm saying thank you and I like it.

146
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,796
Did you guys have a nosebleed?

147
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,251
Do you think you can have a nosebleed?

148
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:05,372
I do!

149
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,640
I see.

150
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,442
Now that you've come to your senses, let's get back to work and go home.

151
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:11,025
Okay.

152
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,675
This is difficult.

153
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:16,103
Okay, you can stop now.

154
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:19,295
I can't do this anymore.

155
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:19,395
Bye!

156
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,242
When you're doing your homework on the S-curve...

157
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,972
Ooga, ooga, ooga.

158
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:42,101
Ooga.

159
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:42,645
Ooga, ooga, ooga.

160
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:43,189
Ooga.

161
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,824
Who are you?

162
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:53,601
I'm a brave Russian.

163
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:07,262
Today on TV, I learned the language of the country of the lord.

164
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:08,951
Do you still remember?

165
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,147
The language of the country of the lord.

166
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,262
Obotara!

167
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:14,704
Obotara!

168
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,573
Yutte goran?

169
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:16,935
Oogini!

170
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,925
Oogini!

171
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,010
Hohohoho, daiseiko!

172
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,119
If you learn a lot of things, you'll have a lot of fun talking.

173
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,848
I hope you have a great day!

174
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:26,570
Great day!

175
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,954
I hope you have a great day!

176
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:28,776
Bye-bye!

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,000
Bye-bye!

178
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,071
Bye-bye!

179
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:50,048
Go!

180
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,168
Choo-choo-choo!

181
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:12,462
Chichi-ka-ka, chichi-ka-ka, chika-chika-chin.

182
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:13,605
