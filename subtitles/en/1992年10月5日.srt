1
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:07,252
Good morning.

2
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:07,619
Good morning. Good morning.

3
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,103
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

4
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:13,159
Both Ugo and Ruga are awake.

0
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:13,861
Yes!

5
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,645
Say that again.

6
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,598
This is too long!

7
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:41,854
Hide the seven boys.

8
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:43,285
Hide the seven boys.

9
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:43,748
Hide the seven boys.

10
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:52,478
Even if you're sleepy, you're cute because you're white.

11
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,172
So, have a good day.

12
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,391
Gokuraku Akiraku Gokuraku

13
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,190
Who are you?

14
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,462
I'm Pandas!

15
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,350
Ooga, ooga, ooga

16
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,395
Thank you for watching!

17
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:26,473
Who woke you up, Buhi?

18
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:30,986
Oh, it's dirty, Buhi!

19
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,158
I'm going to pee, Buhi!

20
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,305
No, Buhi!

21
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,029
Go, Buhi!

22
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,294
First, let's sing our favorite song.

23
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,219
Nikuman?

24
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:42,748
Oh, no, not Nikuman.

25
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,558
Buhi, let's start with Budo.

26
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,892
Buhi, it's Budo.

27
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:47,837
Oh.

28
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,386
What do you think?

29
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:56,574
Do you want to try it?

30
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:56,956
Cow!

31
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:57,237
Wow!

32
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,450
Next is Uwagodabuhi.

33
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,092
Shikadabuhi.

34
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:14,652
Jinn.

35
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:21,538
Jimmie!

36
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:27,452
Good morning.

37
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:30,717
Mr. Katsuhiko Sato of Tokyo University, the great man of the universe.

38
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:38,202
Today, I would like to talk about how far the stars are from each other.

39
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:40,673
The distance between the stars

40
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:51,861
You all know that Molly went to space on a space shuttle, right?

41
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:59,522
But the universe that Mr. Mori went to was the one that circled around the Earth.

42
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,730
The universe is actually much wider.

43
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:08,314
For example, in order to know the direction,

44
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:13,058
You can see the distance by looking at the North Pole.

45
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,570
How far do you think the North Pole is?

46
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:22,263
This is about 400 light years away.

47
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:26,033
In other words, it takes 400 light years.

48
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,332
The distance is 7.5 laps per second.

49
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:35,432
It takes a year to reach such a fast distance.

50
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:42,857
What I'm trying to say is that the Hokkyokusei you're watching now

51
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:50,046
In fact, it is a 400-year-old figure.

52
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:58,703
The universe is so big that it can take light years to reach it.

53
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:31,997
Asano-bun-gaku Iho-ji, Episode 1

54
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:39,456
One day, Murusou heard that his mother had died and ran to her.

55
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:44,603
Everyone in the room was sad and crying.

56
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:51,667
However, Muruso doesn't look sad at all when he sees his mother's dead body.

57
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,660
He seems to be very bored by drinking and sleeping.

58
00:07:56,378 --> 00:08:04,576
And Murusawa went out of the room as if nothing had happened.

59
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:05,038
Next.

60
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:12,065
FIGHT!

61
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,923
FIGHT!

62
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:18,567
I'm Hoshigamuhi.

63
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:20,843
Chinchin.

64
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:21,931
Huh?

65
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:22,132
Chinchin.

66
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:22,656
What's that?

67
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,701
Kinko?

68
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,192
Yeah, kinko.

69
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:29,879
Kinko?

70
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah.

71
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:30,742
Koko.

72
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:31,204
Koko.

73
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:31,385
Kodama.

74
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:31,626
Eh?

75
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,152
Kodama?

76
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:38,679
So that way.

77
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:39,402
Mwah.

78
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:40,968
Mwah.

79
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,735
Mwah.

80
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:43,277
Mwah.

81
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,399
What?

82
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:45,802
What?

83
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,738
What?

84
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:48,222
What?

85
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,982
It's a cow.

86
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:52,585
A cow?

87
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:52,906
Huh?

88
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:53,348
What?

89
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:54,393
A cow?

90
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:54,493
Huh?

91
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:55,779
Is that a cow?

92
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,386
Yeah, it's a cow.

93
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,330
Yeah, it's a cow.

94
00:08:58,951 --> 00:08:59,376
Over here.

95
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:00,085
Cut the video.

96
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:00,672
No!

97
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:01,401
No!

98
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:06,538
But, Karu, we're so tired.

99
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,823
I'm so tired.

100
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,092
My brother's so tired.

101
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,648
Well then, we're going home.

102
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:12,990
Why?

103
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,707
Well then, bye-bye!

104
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,196
Bye-bye!

105
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,267
I have a lot of work to do!

106
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:36,889
When I go to a restaurant, I don't know what to eat.

107
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:43,035
I think you'll know what you want to eat as soon as you have a recipe.

108
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,445
Our job is to make such a recipe.

109
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,691
This is called ROU.

110
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:52,190
This ROU is used to make ROU.

111
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,743
This is used to make food.

112
00:09:54,723 --> 00:10:00,042
Let's make one of your favorites.

113
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:03,113
Do you know what's going to happen?

114
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:12,715
Looks like it's done It looks like real pudding

115
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,145
No, it's wonderful!

116
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:20,441
Next, let's see his best technique.

117
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:23,599
It looks like an amoeba floating on water.

118
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:30,054
What will the green wolf transform into?

119
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:30,315
I don't know

120
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:39,780
This is exactly the same as the real lettuce.

121
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,010
Well done.

122
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:48,406
Let's see how real it is.

123
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:53,569
It's perfect!

124
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,939
This is also a food sample made by him.

125
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:02,158
Simply put, it's the food of Japan.

126
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:10,798
Wrap it gently like this.

127
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:19,405
The tempura looks more delicious than the real one This is the job of a food sample craftsman

128
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,360
If you read a book on the road... ...you'll get hit by a car!

129
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:51,842
Where are you from?

130
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,530
I'm French.

131
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:30,448
The first one is round and round and round and round

132
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:36,928
Absorbs and evolves The tail stretches

133
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,956
Me ga dete kita yo

134
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:05,628
Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka.

135
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,236
Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kaka, Chichi Kachin.

136
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:14,492
Futago no chichi to kaka Shippo ga tore

137
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,436
Eat food and evolve.
