1
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:42,103
Good morning.

2
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:01,932
I'd like to be on TV, but I don't know about you.

3
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,078
That's right.

4
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,691
You look very colorful today.

5
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:07,138
Do you like it?

6
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:08,243
Yes.

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,486
Ugo-go, what do you think of Ryuga today?

8
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:13,455
I think it's good.

9
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:17,748
Well, if you ask me, I'd say it's poisonous.

10
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:18,570
You don't know that, do you?

11
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,897
That's right.

12
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:23,717
To have poison and to control it.

13
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,730
Can you say it?

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,015
Doku wo omo desu.

15
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,724
Doku wo omo desu.

16
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:30,467
Good, good.

17
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:31,109
Well done.

18
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,494
That's all for today.

19
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:32,695
Have fun.

20
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,816
Have fun!

21
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:35,685
Have fun!

22
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:36,897
Have fun!

23
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:40,963
Who is it?

24
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:42,381
Cheers!

25
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:43,393
It's shrimp!

26
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,259
Oto no Hakubutsu-tan!

27
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:53,247
Don't make so much noise You shouldn't Oh, I wouldn't Well, you must And I won't As long as we've got that clear

28
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,980
Nice to meet you.

29
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:02,877
I'm Shure.

30
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:06,814
Nice to meet you.

31
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:08,765
I have a question.

32
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,841
I'm always confused which one to choose.

33
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,108
For example,

34
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:17,388
Which do you like more, dancing or dancing?

35
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,803
Why do you like dancing?

36
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:26,351
I don't know.

37
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't know.

38
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,747
I don't know.

39
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,277
Please dance.

40
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:32,538
Great.

41
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:33,481
Very good.

42
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,092
Can you dance?

43
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:42,858
Let's move on to the next question.

44
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:46,555
Which do you prefer, fish or meat?

45
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,060
Why?

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,185
You don't like meat?

47
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:53,156
Because fish are nutritious.

48
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,642
Meat is nutritious.

49
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,465
I like meat.

50
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,519
Do you eat meat?

51
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes.

52
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,908
Are you on a diet?

53
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:01,029
Yes.

54
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,193
I'm on a diet too.

55
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:06,349
So, the question is...

56
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:16,069
The question is... Is it possible to eat only a little of delicious food?

57
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:21,576
Which do you prefer, bad or disgusting?

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,701
Disgusting!

59
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,988
Hurry up and decide.

60
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:26,791
It's good.

61
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:27,955
A little bit of good food?

62
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:32,370
What are you going to do?

63
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:33,716
Why?

64
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,843
Because... Let's move on to the next question.

65
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:36,285
Is that okay?

66
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:36,526
Yo!

67
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:41,803
Tell us!

68
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:51,338
Great people Good morning Great people of the universe, Professor Kazuhiko Sato of Tokyo University

69
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:57,116
Today, I would like to talk about the size of the universe.

70
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:00,771
The size of the universe.

71
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:10,002
Have you ever seen a beach on a summer night?

72
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:16,110
In fact, the Amano River is a collection of the stars.

73
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:25,594
In fact, the Amano River is a collection of stars, including our sun.

74
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:31,339
This is what we call the galaxy of the Milky Way.

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,875
The size of the galaxy of the Milky Way, where the stars gather,

76
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:43,060
It goes from end to end, and it takes 100,000 years for it to shine.

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,063
So it's about 100,000 light-years away.

78
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:50,273
How big is the universe as a whole?

79
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:56,796
Let's take this galaxy and cut it with a pencil.

80
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,504
Let's say there's a dot on the paper.

81
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,539
Let's say the dot is the size of a galaxy.

82
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:06,060
Then the space is the size of...

83
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
It's as big as the Tokyo Dome.

84
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,275
That's how big it is.

85
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:17,299
Of course, we don't know if the universe is still expanding beyond the Tokyo Dome.

86
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:24,184
But now we know that there is a universe up to that level.

87
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:41,346
Oh, oh, oh.

88
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,749
Asano Bun-gaku Japanese, Part 2

89
00:07:55,788 --> 00:08:00,617
Puruso, who escaped from his mother's funeral, came to the beach.

90
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,490
Ah, the ocean feels so good.

91
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:16,947
A cute girl came to the place where Ursou was swimming.

92
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:17,308
I'm Marie.

93
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,013
The two got along quickly.

94
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,277
Will you marry me?

95
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:27,145
But Murusawa didn't like Marie at all.

96
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,739
To be continued...

97
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:32,808
Drawing and singing.

98
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,373
Which one do you like?

99
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:35,457
Eh?

100
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,285
Which one do you like, Ruka?

101
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,269
Drawing and singing.

102
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:39,449
Singing?

103
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,790
Yes, singing.

104
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:40,392
Drawing!

105
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:41,801
You don't like pigs?

106
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,116
I don't like pigs.

107
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:45,787
You don't sing with them?

108
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:46,028
Pigs.

109
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,223
What do you think?

110
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,154
I like to sing.

111
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:52,899
Really?

112
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,870
Don't you sing with me?

113
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:59,325
One, two, three, four.

114
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,140
I got it.

115
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:09,906
Let's move on to the next question.

116
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,777
Yes, please line up.

117
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,518
Let's move on to the next question.

118
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,550
The last question.

119
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,560
Is it a boy or a girl?

120
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,967
Please say it quickly.

121
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,520
Please say it quickly.

122
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:25,887
It's a girl!

123
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,973
Thank you.

124
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,902
Is this a secret?

125
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:32,610
See you next week.

126
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:33,936
Bye!

127
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,467
I have a lot of work to do!

128
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,713
My job is to cut her hair clean.

129
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,240
I also clean her ears.

130
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,505
It is also the job of a trimmer to cut the nails neatly.

131
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:09,137
Cute pets They are the customers of Trimmer

132
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:17,102
Trimmer's work is being carried out in such a pet shop where they live.

133
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:30,248
The trick to prevent pets from rampaging is to talk to them gently Then, as you can see, they will relax

134
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:40,390
She's getting closer to the beauty again Next is shampoo Don't forget to talk to her here

135
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:41,829
It's so cold.

136
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:49,975
After shampooing, of course, dry it with a dryer.

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,061
She's a good girl.

138
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:00,443
She's a good girl.

139
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:00,825
She's a good girl.

140
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:07,069
If you bring your face to your chest,

141
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:12,836
I can hear the sound of a human heart.

142
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,545
That makes me feel at ease.

143
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:25,378
It's time to cut The barricade she is using is excellent for drying human hair

144
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:30,933
If you do this, any place will be dry as you can see.

145
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,963
This place will be dry as well.

146
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:41,106
The last step is to cut it using scissors.

147
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,345
And it's done See, it shrunk so much that it can be replaced

148
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,489
This is the job of a trimmer.

149
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:55,793
Well done!

150
00:11:56,797 --> 00:12:00,850
It's a wonderful job.

151
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,335
I like dogs and cats.

152
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:07,127
I want them to aim for the top.

153
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:21,252
If you sleep on the road, you'll get hit by a car!

154
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,277
Wheeze.

155
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:37,992
Dingus.

156
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:15,235
Chichi and Kaka At first they are round and round

157
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:24,735
Chichi-ka-ka, chichi-ka-ka, chika-chika-chin

158
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:31,992
Futago no chichi to kaka shippo ga tore

159
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:40,918
Eat food and evolve
