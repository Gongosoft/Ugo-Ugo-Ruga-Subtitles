1
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,602
Hey, Ugo Ugo

2
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:58,070
Today you two look like a festival.

3
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:02,387
I want to see Ruga-chan's face again.

4
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,874
What's that on your cheek?

5
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,732
Did you paint it red?

6
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:13,396
What is it?

7
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:17,694
It's my dad's...

8
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,912
I copied his cheeks.

9
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,282
I copied it, so it looks good on you.

10
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:28,523
By the way, don't tell your wife about the autumn eggplant.

11
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:29,387
Do you know?

12
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,655
I don't know.

13
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,081
What do you know?

14
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:34,445
Aki-nasu.

15
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:35,810
Aki-nasu?

16
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,393
Aki-nasu.

17
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,179
Don't tell your wife.

18
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:40,769
I don't understand.

19
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:44,615
I don't understand the meaning.

20
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,722
That's life, that's life.

21
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:48,349
Okiraku gokuraku.

22
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,004
Okiraku gokuraku.

23
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,518
Okiraku gokuraku.

24
00:01:58,713 --> 00:01:59,603
Who are you?

25
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,091
I'm Jace Sato.

26
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,771
Koto no Hakubu-san!

27
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:01,120
To East of Lugas!

28
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:04,638
Tosa no ma, tosa no ma, tosa no ma, ha!

29
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:06,509
Aya!

30
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,776
Appare, appare!

31
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:14,018
I'm glad I didn't make a mistake.

32
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,888
How many of these numbers are there?

33
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,964
Is the number of Ugo Ugo strong?

34
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:21,639
Numbers?

35
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,527
It's math.

36
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:25,209
Yeah, it's strong.

37
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,573
Then I'll give you a hard one.

38
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,140
Okay, give it to me.

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,666
Supermarkets, well, I didn't have one myself, but in convenience stores,

40
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:43,618
It's a shopping cart made of plastic, but do you know how much it costs?

41
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,287
It's pretty expensive, isn't it?

42
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,871
It's not expensive.

43
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,115
It's just 9 yen.

44
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:57,049
1.

45
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,271
1.

46
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:57,432
1.

47
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:57,673
1.

48
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,055
1.

49
00:04:58,418 --> 00:04:58,699
1.

50
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:58,981
1.

51
00:04:59,001 --> 00:04:59,303
1.

52
00:04:59,323 --> 00:04:59,866
1.

53
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:03,126
1.

54
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:06,868
How many lugs do you think Luger has?

55
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,262
Have you ever gone shopping?

56
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:09,403
Never.

57
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:10,985
Of course not.

58
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,355
The correct answer is 500 yen.

59
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,118
It's a big deal.

60
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:18,347
What do you think?

61
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:27,679
Good morning.

62
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:33,485
Professor Katsuhiko Sato of Tokyo University.

63
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:38,901
Today, I would like to talk about what will happen to the universe.

64
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,635
What will happen to the universe?

65
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:51,625
Now we know that the universe is expanding like a balloon.

66
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:57,582
Will it continue to spread and expand?

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,125
Will it start to shrink this time?

68
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,403
Just like when the air is released from the balloon.

69
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:10,306
Actually, we don't know which one it is yet.

70
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:14,338
However, we can see how fast the universe is expanding.

71
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:21,375
If you can do this properly, you can do this.

72
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:26,674
is the right thing to do.

73
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:33,053
But if the universe starts to shrink in the future,

74
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,590
This is a long, long, long time ago.

75
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,263
So now...

76
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:44,663
There is no need to worry about the shrinking of the universe.

77
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,019
Asano Bungaku!

78
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,641
The Final Episode of the Illegal People!

79
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:22,935
Murusou got used to living alone in the prison.

80
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:31,272
Even though he was about to be executed, he was excited as if he was waiting for his birthday.

81
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,352
I'm looking forward to it.

82
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,857
I hope the day of execution doesn't come soon.

83
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:46,712
Mursong looked at the shining stars from the window of the prison and felt very happy.

84
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:58,592
The end.

85
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,434
Bread, bread, but I can't eat bread.

86
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,279
It's bread.

87
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,849
It's totally different.

88
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,519
Is it different?

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,107
It was good.

90
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,937
It's a frying pan, right?

91
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,204
That's right.

92
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:19,652
As expected of the lord.

93
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:23,027
No, it's not.

94
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:24,573
What is it?

95
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:25,997
It's a panda.

96
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:28,225
I can't eat pandas, but I can answer both.

97
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,383
I said both, so it's my win.

98
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:30,806
Shut up!

99
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:31,028
Shut up!

100
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,521
Don't talk there!

101
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,085
You're kidding!

102
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,398
Hozake is my specialty.

103
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,547
I'm tired, so I'm going to change it.

104
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,498
Can I change it?

105
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:41,522
No.

106
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:51,917
Tosa no ma Tosa no ma Tosa no ma

107
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,678
That's it for now.

108
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:56,120
Goodbye!

109
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:58,609
Not yet.

110
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,195
Not yet, right?

111
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:00,758
You can go home.

112
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:00,878
No!

113
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:08,202
See you next time!

114
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,756
Good luck, good luck.

115
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:15,169
It's hard to go home.

116
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:15,390
Bye bye.

117
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,014
Oshigataippai!

118
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:35,488
I was born and raised in Kasa, and I love making umbrellas.

119
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:42,491
This is an old Japanese umbrella.

120
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,936
It's called wagasa.

121
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,149
It's made of paper and bamboo sticks.

122
00:09:54,858 --> 00:10:01,138
Negishi Nenosuke has been making wagasa since he was 15.

123
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:08,327
What he makes is very different from the one you use He makes it by cutting bamboo

124
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,208
Then, they are cut with a saw.

125
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,997
Then, they are cut with a saw.

126
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:19,228
And then divide it into two parts.

127
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:27,946
And then the umbrella is assembled.

128
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,455
This is his work tool.

129
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,116
Once the umbrella is assembled, the paper is put on it.

130
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:42,583
This is a special mold called washi.

131
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:46,380
Each piece is carefully pasted with glue.

132
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:51,588
It's strange to say this myself, but I have a bad temper.

133
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:57,535
I'm the type of person who wants to do what others don't want to do.

134
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:01,838
I'm really into Mugara right now.

135
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:12,891
Wagasa craftsmen who protect Japanese tradition never give up until the last piece is pasted.

136
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:20,022
He checks the condition of the finished umbrella one by one.

137
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:22,589
This is the job of an umbrella maker.

138
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:22,830
Well done!

139
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:31,314
I think it's the most fun to go all the way to the finish line.

140
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,086
Every craftsman has learned this.

141
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:44,886
When I was in the front line...

142
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,450
Juiz de Burgos!

143
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,902
Who are you?

144
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,000
It's me, the fortune teller.

145
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:28,002
I'll see you in a minute.

146
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,902
Bye bye!

147
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:40,084
Bye bye!

148
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:47,515
It's round in the first place.

149
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,703
Roll, roll, roll, roll

150
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:56,301
Take a bath and evolve Your tail will grow

151
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:09,143
Me ga dete kita yo

152
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:16,416
Kutanbo no chichi to kaka shippo nara

153
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:31,519
Eat your food and evolve!
