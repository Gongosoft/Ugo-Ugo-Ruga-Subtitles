1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,875
Aloha!

2
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:06,470
I remember the words you taught me a long time ago.

3
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,157
Aloha oe.

4
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:08,800
Do you remember?

5
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,067
Do you know Hawaii?

6
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:12,210
Yes, I do.

7
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,156
Do you know where Hawaii is?

8
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,280
Yes, I do.

9
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,208
What kind of place is it?

10
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:18,790
It's over there.

11
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,941
There's a lot of papayas.

12
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,651
There are palm trees and palm trees.

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,738
It's a warm country.

14
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,345
You can say aloha.

15
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:29,329
Look.

16
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:29,610
Aloha!

17
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:33,406
With that in mind, let's have a good time today.

18
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,458
Have a good time!

19
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:37,421
Aloha.

20
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:47,773
I'm a housewife.

21
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:48,135
I'm hungry.

22
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:59,610
Good morning.

23
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:07,667
Mr. Hitoshi Mikami!

24
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:08,892
Let's buy a bed!

25
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:17,127
Today, we're going to find out how to buy Hyomontokage-modoki.

26
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:22,048
Shomon and Kagemotoki live in the desert.

27
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,018
They eat insects and other insects.

28
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,285
When they grow up, they are about 30cm tall.

29
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:34,724
The water tank is about 60cm long.

30
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:35,689
A 60cm water tank.

31
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:42,066
Since we live in a desert area, we need a heater.

32
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:43,975
Make sure it's between 25 and 30 degrees.

33
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:51,474
It warms you up to about 5 degrees.

34
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,982
We also built a place where we can take a day off and go to the sun.

35
00:02:55,025 --> 00:03:01,356
I need a hiding place.

36
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,777
The place to stay is upside down.

37
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:15,801
In the summer, you can bring them here and eat them.

38
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:21,436
When there's no food in winter, we sell corgis at pet shops.

39
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:22,804
I'll give it a try.

40
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:27,310
I'll give you insects such as crickets!

41
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:33,520
If you win the game with Osumiya, you may have children.

42
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:35,089
It's fun.

43
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't know how to do that.

44
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:24,680
Mama.

45
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:24,804
Mama.

46
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:40,835
Wow.

47
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,634
Thank you.

48
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:59,853
Tosa no mo, tosa no mo, tosa no mo, ha!

49
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,750
Aiya, aiya, deyai, deyai, appareja, appareja!

50
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,658
What is it?

51
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,222
I made a good one.

52
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:11,654
Oh, you scared me.

53
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:13,960
I didn't know you were such a great person.

54
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:14,990
Nothing.

55
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,877
Can you see this?

56
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:21,659
What's this?

57
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,863
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,106
What's this?

59
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:25,350
This is for you.

60
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,442
That's right.

61
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,614
Why do you have that seal?

62
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,645
I made it.

63
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,975
What?

64
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,240
Did you make it?

65
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,341
Yes.

66
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,394
There's something written on it.

67
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:37,615
Yeah.

68
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,584
What does it say?

69
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,432
I don't know what it says.

70
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:55,742
Hey, if you want to peel off the sticker cleanly, you need to pour vinegar.

71
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:29,855
When I walk in the city, I see young people using things they don't understand.

72
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,281
They use computers.

73
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,386
I know you're a cousin, but what is a computer?

74
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:38,301
It's not a cousin, it's a cousin.

75
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:40,822
Computer!

76
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:43,785
I've done it before.

77
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,053
What does it mean?

78
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:47,999
I don't know.

79
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:48,200
I see.

80
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,764
It's difficult.

81
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,434
That's what it means.

82
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:57,673
And the young ones were talking to each other, so I listened to them.

83
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:02,357
Then, the lord said, seriously, you're so lame.

84
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,031
Then, with this dog,

85
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:10,331
It's better to say that you can't see a dog.

86
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:12,518
That's right.

87
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,464
Then, Master, come to my castle.

88
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:22,977
He said, let's have the characters scratch their necks.

89
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,842
That's a pretty bold thing to say.

90
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:31,983
We have a lot of work to do!

91
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:32,325
That's right!

92
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,972
Today's work is to be a meteorologist.

93
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:39,091
My job is to bend a glass can and make a Japanese sign.

94
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:42,105
I'm a Japanese artist.

95
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:49,632
The sign that glitters at night is very beautiful.

96
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,977
The sign is a piece of glass called neon.

97
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,870
It's very difficult to bend glass.

98
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,245
If you don't bend it at the right time, it will break.

99
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:11,029
However, Mr. Nihonkan Gikoshi can bend any difficult shape.

100
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,123
Why is it so easy to bend?

101
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:22,403
If you let air in through your mouth, the glass will...

102
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:26,554
That's because Mr. Gikoushi of Neon-Kan knows it

103
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:34,107
I made a neon that matches the red flag!

104
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:34,288
Ugo Ugo!

105
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:34,790
Yeah!

106
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,358
I did it!

107
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:46,737
When you put special gas into the glass can, it turns red When you put another gas, it turns blue

108
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:53,354
Darken the surroundings and switch on!

109
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:53,836
Look!

110
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,650
I made such a beautiful neon sign!

111
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,133
Ya!

112
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:57,655
Ugo Ugo Lula!

113
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:02,953
You can make a big neon sign like this

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,555
This is the work of a Neon Kanji instructor!

115
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:05,656
Wow!

116
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,556
It's beautiful!

117
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:21,447
The second part of Hardy's story, Tess.

118
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,832
In Tess's house, where no one works,

119
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,619
and she was the only one who relied on him.

120
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,983
So, Tess changed her father into a drunkard and started working as a helper at her relative's house.

121
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:34,636
No matter how hard it was, Tess worked hard for the sake of her family.

122
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,252
One day, Alec, the son of the housekeeper, was invited.

123
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:40,095
Everyone likes you, baby.

124
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:44,254
I was wondering what to do next.

125
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:49,579
I was going to give him a baby, but unfortunately, the baby died right away.

126
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:56,257
Hurry up and say the words of your father's country.

127
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm going to say it at the end.

128
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:58,388
Don't rush.

129
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,330
And can you answer my question?

130
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:01,999
Yes.

131
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:10,428
I said, the lord is really lame, but I don't know what it means.

132
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,597
I was happy to praise him.

133
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,445
What does that mean?

134
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:18,603
Dasaai means...

135
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:19,327
I don't know.

136
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:20,292
Dasaai means...

137
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,979
I got it!

138
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:24,886
What is it?

139
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,042
That means I'm not popular.

140
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,460
You!

141
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,589
It's Ugo Ugo Luger!

142
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,181
Please teach me one of my country's words.

143
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:36,744
Okay.

144
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,753
Is that okay?

145
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,904
Yes.

146
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:41,286
Thank you.

147
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:41,949
That's very kind of you.

148
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:46,633
I have a word to say when you're in trouble.

149
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,642
Say, what is it?

150
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:51,249
What is it?

151
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,276
What is it?

152
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:56,067
Mr. Ishii always says that.

153
00:10:58,544 --> 00:10:59,508
Did you know it at first?

154
00:10:59,569 --> 00:10:59,850
I know it.

155
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't know it.

156
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,481
What do you mean by you don't know it?

157
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,204
You say you don't know.

158
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,380
Ah, I see.

159
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,050
There are many ways to say it.

160
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,639
There are many ways to say it.

161
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,329
When you are in trouble, you use the word 偉い.

162
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,190
That's a good one.

163
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,632
That's a good one.

164
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:22,900
You know what?

165
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:23,525
What?

166
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:27,977
You just said it out loud, right?

167
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,006
What's wrong with that?

168
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,224
I won't do anything.

169
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:34,505
That's right.

170
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,149
One day as a runner.

171
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,700
Ozen, you don't even have a job, but you practice in the company.

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,793
You don't get fired easily.

173
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,708
Ooga, ooga, ooga.

174
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,800
Mikan Seijin has appeared.

175
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:05,355
Thank you.

176
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:15,404
I often do it like this.

177
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:15,946
Do it like this.

178
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:20,686
I did it again!

179
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,011
This is what you do when you're in trouble.

180
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,100
No.

181
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,390
This is what you do when you're thinking.

182
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,354
Hey, Mr.

183
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:26,736
Tone!

184
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:27,278
What?

185
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:30,472
Why do you have one tooth when you laugh?

186
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:31,697
Go to the dentist.

187
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,899
I'm gonna cry again.

188
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:44,042
I'm always being swayed by you guys, so when that happens, all I can do is say, I'm sorry.

189
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:44,303
Got it?

190
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:50,511
I don't think I've heard it clearly.

191
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,381
Anyway, I want you to remember that.

192
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:52,723
I got it.

193
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,072
Yes.

194
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:58,157
I'll invite you to my castle soon.

195
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,217
That's right.

196
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:05,397
This is rare, so please look forward to it.

197
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,947
See you later!

198
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,174
See you later!

00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:11,455
Bye-bye!

00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:17,508
A date in the fall!

201
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:17,990
A date in the fall!

202
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,632
A date in the fall!

203
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:19,957
A date in the fall!

204
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:20,700
A date in the fall!

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,242
A date in the fall!

206
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:21,985
A date in the fall!

207
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:28,684
I'm going to eat you alive!

208
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,869
I'm from China!

209
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,016
I have Udon!

210
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:36,639
I have Udon!

211
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,243
I have Udon!

212
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:37,645
I have Udon!

213
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:51,574
Now, you two have become good at the language of the country of the lord, haven't you?

214
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:52,096
Yes.

215
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:53,743
This is called learning rather than learning.

216
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:57,778
It's better to get used to it than to learn it.

217
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,320
Yes.

218
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,732
It's better to get used to it than to learn it than to learn it.

219
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:02,354
Do you understand?

220
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:02,535
Yes.

221
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:03,059
All right.

222
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,431
See you later.

223
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:05,378
Bye-bye.

224
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,568
Bye-bye.
