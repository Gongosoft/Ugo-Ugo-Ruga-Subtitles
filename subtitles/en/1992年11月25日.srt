1
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:48,010
Good morning.

2
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:02,395
Good morning.

3
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:02,676
Good morning.

4
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:05,306
Thank you for the warm greeting.

5
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:07,996
Today's phrase is, Good morning.

6
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:09,542
Good morning.

7
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:11,638
You don't need this.

8
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:12,363
Say, good morning.

9
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:14,942
Good morning.

10
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:21,950
Do you know why they say good morning in the morning?

11
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:23,254
Because it's morning.

12
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:23,595
What about Ugo?

13
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:24,477
Because it's morning.

14
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:31,041
Good morning is the beginning of praising each other for waking up early.

15
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:34,477
It's nice to be praised in the morning, isn't it?

16
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:34,960
Yes!

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,883
So, I hope you all have a happy morning, and I hope you keep saying good morning in a loud voice.

18
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:40,807
Yes!

19
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:41,027
Yes!

20
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:42,272
Is that okay?

21
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,541
Well, then, have a good rest of the day.

22
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,191
Have a good rest of the day!

23
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:47,934
Have a good rest of the day!

24
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:48,456
Yes, well done.

25
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,165
Tasmania Devil!

26
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:56,970
How's that?

27
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,176
How's that?

28
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:09,533
Good morning.

29
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:27,421
I'm going to eat green iguana today.

30
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:27,883
Green iguana!

31
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:28,686
I'm going to eat green iguana with jam.

32
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,010
The maximum height is about 1.8 meters.

33
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,908
We mainly eat fish and vegetables.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,292
If you buy it, prepare a 60cm tank.

35
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:43,975
A 60cm tank.

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,039
I live in a place with a lot of wind, so I need a heater.

37
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:51,585
I set it to about 25 degrees.

38
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,117
Also, you need a place where you can walk in the sun.

39
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,322
Please bring a light bulb there.

40
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:09,990
I like water, so I need a place like that.

41
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,506
I live in the jungle, so I need a place with trees.

42
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:22,586
The vegetables are cabbage and pumpkin.

43
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:26,145
There are also fruits and bananas.

44
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,268
If you get used to it, you can buy it as a gift in Canada.

45
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,017
Please try it.

46
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,170
Thank you for watching!

47
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,403
Okay.

48
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:05,612
Good morning.

49
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,857
Good morning.

50
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,082
Good morning.

51
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:09,348
You're always so cute.

52
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:09,910
Thank you.

53
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,172
Thank you.

54
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,601
In French, it's merci.

55
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,829
Merci.

56
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,094
It's quite similar.

57
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:23,329
Now, Shuru-kun's French lesson.

58
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:23,832
In Japanese...

59
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,695
What's that?

60
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:29,637
In French, it's a keskuse.

61
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:32,064
Ketsukuse.

62
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,689
Not Ketsukuse.

63
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,952
Kesskuse.

64
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:35,534
Kesskuse.

65
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,860
Okay, put your right hand out.

66
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,783
And your index finger.

67
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,393
What is it?

68
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:40,838
What is it?

69
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,478
It's pretty good.

70
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:56,434
Well, if you wrap a disposable回廊 in a lunch box, it will become a special lunch box.

71
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:16,060
Subtitles by SteamTeam

72
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:26,342
Do you want to get 100 points in the test or win the first prize in the relay?

73
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,045
Which do you prefer?

74
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,847
I got 100 points in the test.

75
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,837
What about you, Ugo?

76
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:35,320
I got a relay.

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:35,682
Why?

78
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:36,345
Because my legs get faster.

79
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,592
Have you ever won the first prize with a relay?

80
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,879
I've never been in third place.

81
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,019
I see.

82
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,003
That's pretty good.

83
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,190
Ryuga-chan, why did you get 100 points in the test?

84
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:47,599
It's important.

85
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,189
I want to praise my mom.

86
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:56,695
I see.

87
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,202
That wasn't pork cutlet?

88
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:02,280
Ruga, have you ever gotten a perfect score in a test?

89
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:09,874
But now, there's only one.

90
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,515
I have a lot of work to do!

91
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,062
That's right!

92
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,379
My job is an animal health technician.

93
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,959
My job is to take care of dogs and cats at the animal hospital.

94
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,418
I am an animal health technician.

95
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:41,438
Even healthy dogs sometimes get sick.

96
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,991
In that case, take them to an animal hospital.

97
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:51,319
Animal Health Technician's job is to help the doctor at the animal hospital.

98
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:56,677
If the dog goes wild, you can't check it, so you have to hold it gently to make it easier to check.

99
00:07:56,757 --> 00:08:00,229
I'm going to hold the dog.

100
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,612
The dog is also nervous in front of the doctor.

101
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,859
The dog hates to be examined.

102
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:11,232
But the Animal Health technician is by his side, so the dog is relieved.

103
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:16,127
The inspection is over in no time!

104
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:16,530
Well done!

105
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:24,395
A dog with a serious illness will be hospitalized.

106
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,427
Animal health technician will take care of the dog so as not to make the dog lonely.

107
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:35,228
Depending on the dog's illness, they measure their body temperature and give them medicine.

108
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:45,978
The dog who doesn't like medicine, look!

109
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:46,542
He drank it!

110
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,475
It's okay if it's slimy.

111
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:50,777
Yes!

112
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,280
Well done!

113
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,895
The dog is so energetic that he can even yawn!

114
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:02,166
This is the job of the Animal Health Foundation!

115
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,173
I want to be a dog!

116
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,510
Morning Literature!

117
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,649
Howdy Saku!

118
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:17,492
Test 3!

119
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:22,613
Tess, who was about to forget about the sad event, decided to work in the farm this time.

120
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:28,823
Every day at the farm surrounded by the peaceful nature has healed my broken heart little by little.

121
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:34,172
She was about to fall in love with Claire, the son of a boxer.

122
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:39,285
And on the night of the wedding, Tess told everyone about her misfortune.

123
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:45,883
Then Correa suddenly got angry and left her and went to Brazil alone.

124
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,474
It's time to decide.

125
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:53,362
I'm thinking of something new.

126
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:56,214
Thank you very much.

127
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:56,937
Listen carefully.

128
00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:06,842
The question is, which do you think is more important, the faculty or the students?

129
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:07,930
Elitchin.

130
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,388
Can I ask you something?

131
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,052
Sure.

132
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:13,660
What is Elitchin?

133
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,229
Eri-chin is a Russian word... Oh, sorry.

134
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,534
Eri-chin...

135
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:19,920
Sorry, I'll do it again.

136
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,511
Eri-chin is the president of the Russian Republic.

137
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:27,697
I chose that one.

138
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:28,018
President.

139
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:28,541
What about Gakyuin?

140
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,083
Gakyuin.

141
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,970
Ruga-chan is a great person.

142
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,600
But he's also a great student.

143
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,968
Uogogo-kun, have you ever been a student?

144
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,471
No!

145
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:43,150
I've been doing this since I was in fifth grade.

146
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,691
Shure-kun!

147
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:43,792
Yes?

148
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:44,394
You're great!

149
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:44,715
You're my king!

150
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:45,818
You're great!

151
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:46,380
You're the best!

152
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,144
I see.

153
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,500
It's a life-threatening episode.

154
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,404
La question.

155
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,853
A date with Nagisa Oshima or a date with Nagisa Oshima?

156
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,415
Which is better?

157
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:10,619
I don't know what you're talking about.

158
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,001
Hmm...

159
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,646
One day of a runner.

160
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:23,488
Even if you eat a lot, you can't take it.

161
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:25,696
Wow!

162
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,377
Ugo Ugo Luger Fever!

163
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,866
Mikau Seijin appears.

164
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,890
Hola!

165
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:48,615
Hola!

166
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:06,250
UNAGI NO KIMOTO DONNA TOKI MO

167
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,808
Shiro-kun is really persistent.

168
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,856
But there are people who are really looking forward to this.

169
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:15,261
Well then, here you go.

170
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:20,122
No matter what, no matter what...

171
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,387
This is the violin part.

172
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:30,381
Every time, every time, whenever I become who I am,

173
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:38,177
I want to hold on to the feeling of liking what I like.

174
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,442
It's wonderful.

175
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,046
Shura!

176
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:48,350
Which do you like more, Tokimo or Eton Maki Maki?

177
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,838
That's a hard one.

178
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:54,124
Let's go!

179
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,387
How about you, Tajima?

180
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,321
How about you, Buoko?

181
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,140
I said my real name.

182
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,547
Let's sing together.

183
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,830
3, 2, 1, go!

184
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,905
Maki maki tomaki maki Hite hite ton ton ton

185
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:22,589
It was pretty fun.

186
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:26,401
Now, I'm going to go back to France.

187
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,745
See you!

188
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:28,667

00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,235

00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:31,536
Bye-bye!

191
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,326
A date in the fall!

192
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:40,125
Abe-kun, who is on a date, is trying to set a trap!

193
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:47,601
You're going to get punched in the back!

194
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:51,973
Who are you?

195
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:56,157
I'm the late, late, late, late, late...

196
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:08,020
Lastly, I'll teach you the words you need to say on TV.

197
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,703
Thank you.

198
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:09,707

Monoie.

206
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:25,536
Monoie means to listen to other people's stories.

207
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:25,998
Yes!

208
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,609
This is pretty hard, but let's practice.
