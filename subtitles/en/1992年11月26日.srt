1
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:44,081
Good morning.

2
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:44,965
Good morning.

3
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,296
Oh, it's upside down.

4
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:47,858
Oh, it's upside down.

5
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:05,749
Good morning.

6
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,634
Good morning.

7
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:10,656
Ugo and Luga, if you get a bad score in the school test, will you keep whining?

8
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,263
No, we won't.

9
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,749
No, we won't.

10
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,701
I'll tell you exactly what we're going to say.

11
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:16,942
Okay?

12
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:17,465
Okay.

13
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:18,790
The wind will blow tomorrow.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,905
Tomorrow will be another stormy day.

15
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:23,287
Yes.

16
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:26,358
They say they failed, but they can't help it.

17
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:27,683
They're determined to work hard tomorrow.

18
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,214
It's a very easy word.

19
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,805
Remember it.

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:31,530
Yes.

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,709
Okiraku gokuraku!

22
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,924
Okiraku gokuraku!

23
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:37,909
Yes, yes.

24
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:43,028
Who are you?

25
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:45,079
I'm Harapeko Daisaku.

26
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,292
I'll be waiting for you in January.

27
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:59,070
Good morning.

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:09,600
Hikari Hito Mikami Hitoshi Sensei Hikari Hito Kaoru

29
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,790
Today, we're going to find a common fish.

30
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:22,290
How to buy Hyomoon Rikusame Hyomoon Rikusame is an African grassland desert.

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,327
The male is about 50 cm and the female is about 70 cm.

32
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:33,543
We have a 60-centimeter tank for you.

33
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:38,288
A 60-centimeter tank?

34
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:44,878
I live in a warm place, so I need a heater.

35
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,248
I set it to about 25 degrees.

36
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,607
I'll warm it up to about 25 degrees.

37
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:59,896
You need a place where you can play in the sun, so you can put a light bulb there.

38
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,900
Let's make a warm place.

39
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:09,408
I like to cook with water, so I'd like to add something that can be cooked with water.

40
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:12,238
I'll make something that can be cooked with water.

41
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:12,679
Soba.

42
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:19,969
It's an ornament, so there are vegetables like cabbage and pumpkin.

43
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:24,441
I'd like you to try some banana-like fruits.

44
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:34,558
You don't have to change the water in the aquarium.

45
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:38,211
It's easy to change.

46
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:39,460
Give it a try.

47
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,545
Toh no hakubu-san!

48
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:52,494
Bye-bye!

49
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:53,217
Bye-bye!

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,443
Bye-bye!

51
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:55,026
Bye-bye!

52
00:04:55,394 --> 00:05:00,449
I always end up falling apart, so everyone calls me a robot.

53
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:05,404
I'm a little sad, so I want to do my best.

54
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:06,829
We look forward to working with you.

55
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,892
We look forward to working with you.

56
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:08,976
We look forward to working with you.

57
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,862
We look forward to working with you.

58
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:11,705
We look forward to working with you.

59
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,488
We look forward to working with you.

60
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:13,692
We look forward to working with you.

61
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,635
We look forward to working with you.

62
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,103
What's the big deal?

63
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,187
I got it!

64
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:19,255
What?

65
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,127
Uga-Uga-Kan. A company!

66
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:23,936
I see.

67
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,671
It's big, isn't it?

68
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,164
But there are small companies, too.

69
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,757
Wait, wait, wait.

70
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:39,643
My answer is big.

71
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,912
Don't break it by yourself.

72
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,429
If you leave the burnt bread in the fridge, it will become smelly.

73
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:11,343
Go, Go, Lula!

74
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:12,229
Give me a seat!

75
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:38,063
Let's go!

76
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,624
Okay!

77
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:41,011
Um, Ugo Ugo, how big are your shoes?

78
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,140
Are you awake?

79
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,970
You're still sleeping, aren't you?

80
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,322
One hundred!

81
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,508
One hundred?

82
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,413
No way!

83
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:53,189
Nineteen!

84
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:53,931
Nineteen centimeters.

85
00:06:54,393 --> 00:07:00,694
But you know, if you put something like this in the shape of a shoe, it'll fit perfectly.

86
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,444
But if you don't put it in, it'll get soggy.

87
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:05,807
21!

88
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,655
And then, the shoes.

89
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:13,452
If the shoes are small, they become old.

90
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:19,358
If that's the answer...

91
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:20,083
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,410
I have a lot of work to do!

93
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,952
That's right!

94
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,377
Today's work is a mask craftsman.

95
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:36,405
My job is to make masks for pro wrestlers.

96
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:37,532
I'm a mask maker.

97
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:48,583
This is a special cloth that can only be stretched sideways.

98
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:49,969
Only the mask craftsman can make a mask that cannot be torn or torn.

99
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:56,213
Especially around the eyes, it is easy to tear, so sew it carefully.

100
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:02,720
Make sure you match the parts you made to your head.

101
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:05,931
Perfect!

102
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:06,152
Great job!

103
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:12,193
The coolest part of Thunder Liger's mask is this horn.

104
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:17,779
The mask craftsman knows how to make it look cool.

105
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,197
When the mask is ready, he will wear it himself to make sure.

106
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,004
Jyushin Thunder Liger is here.

107
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:24,606
How is it?

108
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,192
It looks strong, doesn't it?

109
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:26,875
No, it's great.

110
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,785
This is the job of a mask craftsman!

111
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:32,055
Put on the mask again!

112
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:43,598
The Literature of the Day!

113
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:44,627
Hardy's Tests, Episode 4

114
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:53,233
After Claire left him, Ruth waited for him to come back.

115
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:57,659
However, the misfortune of her father's death again attacks her.

116
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,766
Father's fool!

117
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,456
Onee-chan, I'm hungry.

118
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:09,028
For the family who were more and more troubled by life, it was only possible to take care of that Aleph again.

119
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:17,315
Even though a tree is a tree, what tree grows in the stomach?

120
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,580
It's difficult.

121
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:23,080
What's in your stomach?

122
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,750
My heart and my heart.

123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,713
I don't know.

124
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:37,699
I don't have time to answer your questions.

125
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,966
There's no such thing as no time.

126
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,323
It feels good.

127
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:45,928
I'll give you an answer.

128
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:46,089
Okay.

129
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:49,443
Don't say, hurry, hurry.

130
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:49,684
Okay.

131
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,250
The tree that grows in your stomach

132
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:55,107
My name is Ichou.

133
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:56,974
Why?

134
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,603
I have to explain.

135
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,214
What are you doing?

136
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:15,482
Sato-san and Yamada-san were there.

137
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:23,509
When I told Sato-san and Yamada-san that I was going out, who went out first?

138
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:26,198
Sato-san!

139
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:27,036
Why?

140
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:27,417
Why?

141
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:29,423
Why, Sato-san?

142
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:34,417
Sato-san is a woman.

143
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:35,580
Yes, a woman.

144
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:37,428
Why?

145
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,442
And what about Yamada-san?

146
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,988
Yamada-san is also a woman.

147
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,161
No, no, no.

148
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:46,025
Tell me why.

149
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:46,527
Nakada-san?

150
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,340
Nakada-san isn't here.

151
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,831
With Sato-san!

152
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,720
Sato-san, what are you doing?

153
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,258
Isn't that Satsuma-chan?

154
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:58,021
No, it's not.

155
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,629
You can't do that in the middle.

156
00:10:59,649 --> 00:10:59,830
Sato-san!

157
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,301
Sato-san, that's the right answer.

158
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:03,882
But why?

159
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,436
Sato means... Sato...

160
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:13,683
Hold it in your hand and shake it.

161
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:18,679
If you shake it and put your hand in front of it, it's faster.

162
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:31,757
One day, a runner... Nobunaga is ready to compete with a car.

163
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:40,920
Mikan Seijin appears.

164
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,081
The answer is Mr. Sato.

165
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:57,583
Yay!

166
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,717
Sato?

167
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:03,027
I don't think you know the answer.

168
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,105
Yes?

169
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:06,823
What was the meaning of that?

170
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,642
When Sato-san said he was going,

171
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:16,678
Mr. Yamada said he couldn't go out yet.

172
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,442
I might have been fooled.

173
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm so frustrated.

174
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:26,381
But I'll do my best this time, so you won't make fun of me.

175
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,371
I'll do my best!

176
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:28,491
Yeah!

177
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,796
Let's do our best, Ugaoka!

178
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:32,254
Let's do our best, Ugaoka!

179
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:37,232
It was really exciting, so I'm going home.

180
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,863
I'm going home soon.

181
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,670
I'll do my best next time.

182
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,037
Well, bye-bye!

183
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:47,340
Bye-bye!

184
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,129
An Autumn Date

185
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,179
What if I eat Abe-kun's frozen meal?

186
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:06,207
Who is it?

187
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:10,003
From the morning onward, I'm going to kick your ass!

188
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,310
Today's theme is recycling.

189
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,590
Have you ever heard of recycling?

190
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:25,830
No.

191
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:26,794
What does it mean?

192
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:32,122
You can't throw it into the ocean.

193
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,609
Well, it's similar, but a little different.

194
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,615
Recycling is throwing something you've used once

195
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,652
and use it again in a different form.

196
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:44,158
In other words, the empty cans you put on paper today are also recycled.

197
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,445
Got it?

198
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:46,410
Yes.

199
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,285
It's an important word, so remember it.

200
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:49,647
Yes.

201
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,597
That's all for today.

202
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,381
Bye-bye.

203
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:52,562
Bye-bye.

204
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:08,121
Go!

205
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,544
Choo-choo, caw-caw.

206
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:19,950
Choo-choo, caw-caw.

207
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:30,621
Chichi-ka-ka, Chichi-ka-ka, Chika-chika-chin.

208
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:31,965
Futago-no-chichi-to-ka-ka, Shippo-ra-to-ka-ka.

209
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:41,567
Kero kero kero kero Gohan o tabete sinka suru
