1
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:05,228
Good morning.

2
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,652
Good morning.

3
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,100
Today is Friday, the day of breakfast.

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,986
Before breakfast, let's say a few words.

5
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:11,327
Yes.

6
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:11,989
Okay?

7
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,399
Asameshimae.

8
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:14,705
Asameshimae.

9
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:15,850
Do you know it?

10
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,854
No, I don't.

11
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,205
Do you know it, Ryuga?

12
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,089
No, I don't.

13
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,000
Asameshimae means something that can be done easily.

14
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,689
Did you get it?

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,211
Yes!

16
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:31,304
Asameshi is not a good word, but it's a good word to use.

17
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,029
Remember asameshimae.

18
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,855
Yes!

19
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,632
That's all for today.

20
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:40,489
Have fun!

21
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,113
Have fun!

22
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:41,536
Have fun!

23
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:41,757
Well done!

24
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:49,806
Kega-nin desu.

25
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:06,495
Oto no Hakubu-san!

26
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:15,820
It's time for breakfast.

27
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,762
Do you all remember your spells?

28
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,064
Yes, we do.

29
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:20,627
Go ahead.

30
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,073
Tak-shak!

31
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,540
Tak-shak!

32
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:23,982
Ran-ran-poo!

33
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,533
Yes, the TV is going first.

34
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:52,175
Welcome.

35
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,245
Please come in.

36
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:54,668
Itadakimasu.

37
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:55,170
Please eat.

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,387
Duck it.

39
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:05,634
Duck it.

40
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:16,483
Sesame has a lot of vitamin C, so your skin will be smooth.

41
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,179
Your skin will be more beautiful when you eat sesame seeds.

42
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,435
I like salmon.

43
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,113
Yes.

44
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,944
What kind of beans are these?

45
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:58,620
These are Japanese beans.

46
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:08,115
Greenpeace's Wafu Potage Soup And Greenpeace!

47
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,100
Greenpeace and...

48
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:16,060
I know that Greenpeace hates children on TV, so I made it into soup.

49
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,220
This is Greenpeace.

50
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,787
I always eat it.

51
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,831
Do you eat it?

52
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:26,105
How about you, Ryuga?

53
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:26,768
I like this flavor.

54
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,717
I'll sit.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,913
If you think you caught a cold, you should go to bed right away.

56
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,275
Thank you very much.

57
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,258
Don't talk to each other.

58
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:50,288
Tell the TV.

59
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,735
No, everyone will know.

60
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:52,780
Tell them.

61
00:06:53,333 --> 00:07:00,126
I made a lot of rice, so I'll teach you how to make it.

62
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,352
It's so good!

63
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:04,086
I'm so surprised.

64
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,188
Ugo Ugo is hungry now.

65
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,039
Are you two satisfied?

66
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,682
Yes!

67
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,766
What about you?

68
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:18,818
We are satisfied!

69
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:23,954
Do you remember the spell to go back to your room?

70
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:24,916
Yes, I do.

71
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:25,578
Say it.

72
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,103
Yes, I'll go back to my room first.

73
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:32,098
Puku puku nan puku nan puku pu!

74
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:48,697
Guppy, taboo, taboo!

75
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:49,921
Guppy, taboo, taboo!

76
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,182
Boo-hee!

77
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:50,965
Boosh, boosh, boosh, boosh!

78
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:51,744
Boo-hyo!

79
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:52,507
Boo-hyo!

80
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:53,754
Ya-ho!

81
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,201
Ya-ho!

82
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:58,758
You guys had breakfast again, didn't you?

83
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,200
Yeah!

84
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,350
This is so unfair!

85
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:06,355
I'm starving.

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,061
Huh?

87
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,070
You're all dressed up weird!

88
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,277
Huh?

89
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,222
Ugo Ugo-kun and Luga-chan?

90
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:16,125
Yeah!

91
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,184
Huh?

92
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:18,285
Huh?

93
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:31,520
We've got a lot of work to do!

94
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,841
That's right!

95
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,827
Today's work is by Narrator Companion.

96
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:43,193
My job is to introduce and explain products at events and exhibitions.

97
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:46,078
I am a narrator companion.

98
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:52,564
When a new product is made, an event is held to show it to everyone.

99
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:57,283
All the products are still unknown to everyone, so it's a little difficult just to watch.

100
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,348
I have no idea.

101
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:08,370
Narrator Companion can explain how to use the products here easily to anyone.

102
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:19,778
It's very difficult to explain the new product No matter how long the explanation is, the narrator companion will be able to memorize it

103
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:29,127
He is very good at speaking So everyone is listening to him Well done

104
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:33,051
Narrator Companion has thin legs and long hair.

105
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,157
He looks like an idol.

106
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:39,690
The way he holds the microphone is perfect.

107
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:48,448
If you speak with a microphone like this, the sound won't leak to the surroundings, so the voice of the familiar companion will be heard as it is.

108
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:49,414
Look!

109
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,091
More and more people are coming!

110
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:52,836
Great!

111
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,036
This is the job of a narrator-companion!

112
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:58,793
Amazing!

113
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,294
Morning Literature!

114
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,483
Hardy Saku Test Introduction!

115
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:19,147
Clare, who had been waiting for a long time, has finally returned to Tess, who had been living in Alec's mansion.

116
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,612
Don't look at Clare's face.

117
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:28,364
I thought I was going to kill Alec.

118
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:28,484
What?

119
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:28,584
Why?

120
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:28,685
Why?

121
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,170
The two of them ran away from the mansion.

122
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,872
Don't ever come to me alone again.

123
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:35,884
Tess was happy to be born in such a fun time.

124
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:42,415
Soon after, she was arrested by the police and arrested.

125
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:54,126
What if they eat too much food and get bigger and bigger?

126
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:58,007
If it gets as big as Godzilla...

127
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,126
What are you going to do?

128
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:05,420
I'm going to work out hard.

129
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:06,464
Work out?

130
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:07,187
I...

131
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,038
I'm going to scare people!

132
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:12,342
How?

133
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:12,723
Scream!

134
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:13,766
Can you really enjoy it?

135
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,654
Can you enjoy it?

136
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,401
Poor thing, isn't she?

137
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:21,004
Poor thing?

138
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:21,748
Who?

139
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:24,602
When she was walking,

140
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:30,668
What will you do if you destroy the company?

141
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,838
I thought it was a good time.

142
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,082
That's right.

143
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:41,072
We'll see you next time!

144
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:46,887
Is there anything you want to do as an adult?

145
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:47,208
Yes!

146
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,193
No!

147
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:53,223
R-Ruga-chan, what do you do?

148
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,433
I'm an actress!

149
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:55,794
An actress?

150
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,481
What does an actress do?

151
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:57,863
Here's a question!

152
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:02,976
Don't you always say that you're an actress?

153
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:07,006
Because I really want to be one.

154
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,376
Stop it, you two.

155
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:09,338
Why?

156
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,527
What are you doing?

157
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,545
What did I just say?

158
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:16,790
What did you say?

159
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,091
No.

160
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:17,995
What?

161
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:19,080
Actress?

162
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,323
Why do you have to be an adult to become an actress?

163
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,111
One day, a runner...

164
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:34,050
At night, they practice even in their dreams.

165
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,886
The family is not satisfied.

166
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,937
The End.

167
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:39,459
Wow!

168
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:41,990
Uro, Uro, Uya!

169
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:45,345
Ah, God!

170
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,534
Uro, Uro, Uya!

171
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:47,695
Kawaii!

172
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,812
Mikan Seijin is here.

173
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:08,400
Mwah!

174
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,922
That's enough!

175
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,682
Latte-ssu!

176
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:19,858
It comes out of the nose like this.

177
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:23,558
See you next week.

178
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:28,836
Next time, I'm going to make a mushroom that even you know.

179
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:29,680
Mr.

180
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:30,303
Pig.

181
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,111
What?

182
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:34,422
Next time, make sure you eat properly.

183
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,650
All right, then.

184
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,059
I hope you don't fall.

185
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,728
And don't let your nose bleed.

186
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,276
But, but, I'm so excited.

187
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:47,826
If I get in trouble, I'll come out.

188
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:48,428
I got it.

189
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,718
Then I'll make a tissue and put it in your nose.

190
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,133
I'll give it a try.

191
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:55,601
I'll give it a try next time!

192
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:55,803
Okay!

193
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:57,895
I think you should give it a try.

194
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:58,825
Thank you.

195
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,636
Thank you for the advice.

196
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:06,708
Well then, see you next week!

197
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:07,269
Bye-bye!

198
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:07,530
Bye-bye!

199
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,606
An autumn date!

200
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:15,276
I'm going to take a picture of Abe-kun on the bench.

201
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,342
You're going to get beaten up!

202
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:29,959

Kegani desu!

205
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,261
Now, let's play a game from the TV.

206
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:41,663
Okay.

207
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:45,740
If you catch a cold on the TV, what will you give to the visitor?

208
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,773
A bouquet of flowers!

209
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,879
You are.

210
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:54,445
What do you want, Ryuga?

211
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:56,114
I got it.

212
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:56,637
What is it?

213
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:57,967
A toy.

214
00:14:59,033 --> 00:14:59,515
A toy?

215
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:01,083
What kind of toy?

216
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,530
A car.

217
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,555
I can't wait.

218
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,247
But don't catch a cold.

219
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,704
You two will be fine today.

220
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:08,812
Bye-bye.

221
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:09,597
