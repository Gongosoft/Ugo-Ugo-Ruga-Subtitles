1
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,867
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:00,981
Happy New Year!

3
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,387
Happy New Year!

4
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,274
This way, please.

5
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:05,539
Okay, thank you.

6
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:09,333
Today, we'll be using words that are appropriate for the new year.

7
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:09,453
Okay?

8
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:09,694
Okay!

9
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:11,804
One year's salary is in the bank.

10
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:15,803
One year's salary is in the bank.

11
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:22,005
This means that the goal of living this way this year is to think about the New Year.

12
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:25,759
Did you two think about the New Year this year?

13
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,735
I haven't thought about it.

14
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,621
You haven't thought about it at all, have you?

15
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:31,862
Yes.

16
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,226
All right, then.

17
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,089
Happy New Year!

18
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,691
Happy New Year!

19
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:36,036
Happy New Year!

20
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:39,620
Happy New Year!

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,727
Happy New Year!

22
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:46,856
Who are you?

23
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,059
I'm the father bug.

24
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,264
Congratulations.

25
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:14,899
Today, let's make potato soup together.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,610
The ingredients are potatoes, seasonal green beans, and ground meat.

27
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,318
It's like this.

28
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,305
It's very easy.

29
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,521
I don't like potatoes.

30
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:38,322
Boil the potatoes well and crush them.

31
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,384
Put the mashed potatoes aside.

32
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:46,422
Then, fry the meat in a frying pan.

33
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:50,113
Then pour in the soup.

34
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:54,274
If you don't have soup, pour in hot water.

35
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,344
Then add the soup base.

36
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:04,527
We add all the green beans and potatoes.

37
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,498
We make a thin batter to make the torogi.

38
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,638
That's how it's made.

39
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,590
Thicken with potato starch.

40
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,961
This soup is very warm in this cold weather.

41
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:27,116
It's delicious.

42
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:28,542
The sage appears.

43
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,138
Mochi, mochi, mochi, mochi, mochi, mochi, mochi!

44
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,255
Happy New Year!

45
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,385
Happy New Year!

46
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,169
Thank you!

47
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,742
Here we go!

48
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:54,445
Ready, go!

49
00:03:54,425 --> 00:04:00,351
Don't get in the way of our date!

50
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:06,251
What should I do?

51
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,656
Is it too early?

52
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:09,683
I think I can sing well this year, too.

53
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:18,205
It's New Year's Eve!

54
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:25,433
On New Year's Day, we'll have octopus, and we'll spin a ball and play.

55
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,942
On New Year's Day...

56
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:34,118
Isn't it over?

57
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:34,762
Really?

58
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:39,366
The New Year should be over by now.

59
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,400
What day is today?

60
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,390
It's January 4th, right?

61
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,153
January 5th.

62
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:55,870
One day, Luger will be born!

63
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,818
Happy New Year.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,999
The New Year's Day doesn't seem to come as often as it used to.

65
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,745
One, two, three, go.

66
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,351
Ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga!

67
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,680
Happy New Year!

68
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,314
Yeah, rage on!

69
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:17,775
Yeah!

70
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:17,896
Yeah!

71
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:17,976
OK.

72
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,705
Uga uga ruga.

73
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,633
Happy New Year.

74
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:30,958
In the winter of 1995, the city of Hanano was at the entrance of Tokyo.

75
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,185
A young man had just arrived at Ueno station.

76
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:38,395
Oh, here it is!

77
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:41,446
This is Tokyo, where all kinds of delicious food gather!

78
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:42,951
Let's eat and eat and eat!

79
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:52,519
His name is Daisaku Harapeko.

80
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:56,097
He came to Tokyo to eat delicious food from all over the world.

81
00:05:56,617 --> 00:06:00,755
Other than that, we don't know who he is.

82
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,447
It smells like foreign food!

83
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,597
Oh, this smell!

84
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,685
The Harapiko strategy.

85
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:12,246
It's a mysterious power that allows him to draw a picture of the past 500 meters away.

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,811
Saku Chodai suddenly ran over.

87
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,195
Oh, it's coming this way!

88
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,724
Did Makamon eat it?

89
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:24,008
There's a shop in a quiet corner.

90
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:29,880
There was a 25-year-old father on the road.

91
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,583
I'm sorry!

92
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,474
I'm starving!

93
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:36,497
Who is this man?

94
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:39,448
The mystery calls the mystery.

95
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:41,669
Mr.

96
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,849
Potato finally gave me a call.

97
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,181
Then he said he'd cut it off.

98
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:58,247
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

99
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:04,552
Did you get a phone call?

100
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:04,974
Listen to the story.

101
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,198
This is Luger's house.

102
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:06,600
Goodbye.

103
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:16,253
Do you want to listen to my story?

104
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,685
Yes.

105
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:17,991
Really?

106
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:31,525
It's a real museum!

107
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:18,403
Morning Literature Lesson 1 Red and Black

108
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,014
There was a young man named Julian in a town in Switzerland.

109
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,368
He was strongly admired by the great hero Napoleon.

110
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:30,931
One day, Julian became a family teacher for a child of Renard, who was a butterfly.

111
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,600
He met Mrs. Renard and fell in love with her.

112
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,992
I have something to tell you.

113
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,480
What is it?

114
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,752
You'll fall in love with me.

115
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:38,873
What?

116
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,341
You'll fall in love with me.

117
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:46,602
Mrs. Renard also fell in love with him, and they started to love each other more and more.

118
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:57,823
Next time, when I call him, I'll tell him that I'm going on a date with him.

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,713
I'd like to, but... What's a killer monk?

120
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:14,125
Something that makes you want to go on a date with me.

121
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:23,288
What do you think I should do?

122
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:30,055
Please give me a good answer.

123
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:34,111
Tell me before you die.

124
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,658
Ugo Ugo God, please.

125
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,492
I won't tell you.

126
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:41,783
I'm so surprised!

127
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:47,956
You can write a New Year's card.

128
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:48,418
A New Year's card?

129
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:48,900
No.

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,562
I already wrote it.

131
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,786
It's a letter.

132
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:54,554
New Year's letters are almost the same.

133
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,036
Really?

134
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:58,185
They're the same.

135
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,328
Why are they so similar?

136
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,123
You can't ask me that.

137
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:08,918
What do you write on New Year's Eve?

138
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,394
That's right.

139
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:18,975
It's coming this year, isn't it?

140
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:24,251
Today is January 4th.

141
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,464
January 5th is Ruka's birthday.

142
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:28,965
I want her to come soon.

143
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:38,331
Happy birthday to you.

144
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:46,242
The ambition of a non-selling manzai writer.

145
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:47,950
The story of the first TV.

146
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,958
Three days later.

147
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,341
Look out!

148
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:53,823
Look out!

149
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:54,284
Look out!

150
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,114
Whoopi, do you hear?

151
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,800
Hi, Mom.

152
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,633
Ooga ooga looga.

153
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:01,881
Happy New Year's.

154
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:02,686
Happy New Year's.

155
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,061
Love and peace.

156
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:29,631
Oh, yeah

157
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,875
Yeah.

158
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:43,603
Oh, yeah.

159
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:50,708
It's my birthday this year, Masao!

160
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,013
In fact, Mr.

161
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,894
Potato is called Mr.

162
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:12,156
Vegetable.

163
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:19,547
There's a rumor that she went to a hair salon with a beautiful shiitake mushroom.

164
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,681
That's right.

165
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,412
It's called Miss Vegetable.

166
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,558
So you two are lovers?

167
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,706
So you two are lovers?

168
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:31,913
Did you hate me?

169
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:35,283
Then you should be with Celery-kun.

170
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,226
Celery-kun?

171
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,696
Celery alone is perfect.

172
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,340
Wait.

173
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,483
I have a question.

174
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,128
Who did you ask about tomatoes?

175
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:46,775
About the rumors?

176
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:47,216
Yes.

177
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:49,281
My friend's tomatoes.

178
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:50,053
Eh.

179
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:51,542
Eh?

180
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:55,486
I asked my friend, Tomato.

181
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:57,733
Are there two Tomatoes?

182
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,081
There are a lot.

183
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:00,402
Of course.

184
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:01,566
Tomato's mom said

185
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:02,671
Tomatoes.

186
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,340
That's right.

187
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,897
Mom likes tomatoes, too.

188
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,143
Also, tomatoes...

189
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:13,431
Your country is full of tomatoes.

190
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,403
Hmm.

191
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:20,415
I learned it from the beginning.

192
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,730
I think I have to be strong this year.

193
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,628
Thank you so much for today.

194
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,275
Yeah.

195
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:34,909
Please take care of me this year, too.

196
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,375
Then, let's go home together!

197
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's go home together!

198
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,180
Bye-bye!

199
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,893
Toshidohajime no Toshidama!

200
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:51,200
He's been buying a lot of toys until the end of the year!

201
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,030
Sakamoto, the real deal, is getting beaten up by Guryan Guryan!

202
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:58,637
I'm going to be blown away by the wind!

203
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,319
Who are you?

204
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:11,445
I am the great Obugyo-sama, Pandani.

205
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:28,159
The dream you see on August 2nd is called your first dream.

206
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:32,514
I'll teach you the words of your first dream, okay?

207
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:32,574
1.

208
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:33,096
Fuji 2.

209
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,160
Taka 3.

210
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,902
Nasubi

211
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:42,883
NITAKA 1 FUJI 2 TAKA 3 NASUBI

212
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:44,582
I don't know.

213
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:47,291
My first dream... Can I say it?

214
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,321
The first thing that happens to me in my dream is that Mt.

215
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:50,983
Fuji is the best.

216
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:54,859
Takaga is number 2, and Nasubi is number 3.

217
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,253
But there's no one who dreams of Nasubi.

218
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:58,594
What is Nasubi?

219
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:01,567
There's no one who dreams of the same thing, right?

220
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:02,029
Yeah.

221
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:05,685
Well then, I'll see you again next year!

222
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:06,388
Bye-bye!

223
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:07,352
Bye-bye!
