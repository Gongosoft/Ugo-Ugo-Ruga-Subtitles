1
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:07,594
Good morning.

2
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:08,136
Good morning.

3
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:08,940
How are you?

4
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,606
Let's start with today's words.

5
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:10,727
Okay?

6
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:10,847
Okay.

7
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:11,972
It's a long one.

8
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:16,149
It's the same as crying and living.

9
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:17,936
It's the same as laughing and living.

10
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:19,201
There's more.

11
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,747
It's the same as laughing and living.

12
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:30,737
This means that no matter how you feel, you will live the same life, so it is better to live with a smile on your face.

13
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,812
That's right.

14
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:35,480
That's right.

15
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,545
Laugh, laugh.

16
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,480
Well, for the time being, let's laugh a lot this year.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:39,580
Yes!

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,855
That's why today, we're having a great time!

19
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,553
We're having a great time!

20
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:45,419
We're having a great time!

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,942
Yes, well done!

22
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:55,695
Who are you?

23
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:05,027
Great People!

24
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,682
Good morning, everyone.

25
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:09,786
Great People of Chinese Cuisine!

26
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:14,071
Mr. Shu Tomidoku!

27
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:14,916
Let's make Chinese food!

28
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,122
Today, let's make shumai together.

29
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:28,652
The ingredients are ground pork, shrimp,

30
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:42,338
They put it in a bowl and add salt, pepper, soy sauce and sesame oil.

31
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,523
Add some flavor with the egg.

32
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,311
Mix it well.

33
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,758
Mix it well until it becomes sticky.

34
00:02:51,532 --> 00:03:00,630
The point of this dish is to make a knot and wrap it with the skin.

35
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,077
It takes 18 minutes to cook.

36
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,807
18 minutes to cook.

37
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:11,296
It's a delicious dish that goes well with spicy soy sauce.

38
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,021
It's called ebi shio.

39
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:20,748
Today, I'll take you to a very fun dance room.

40
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,884
Make a spell in front of the door.

41
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,068
Do you remember the spell?

42
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:26,574
Yes, I do.

43
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:29,966
Say it.

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,672
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

45
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:31,993
That's right.

46
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,739
You're not good at dancing on TV, so sit down.

47
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:52,462
waiting for me.

48
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:52,825
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:00,795
Everybody!

50
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:00,996
Mr. Tony!

51
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:01,177
Come on!

52
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:01,498
Happy New Year!

53
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:02,739
Happy New Year!

54
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,180
Happy New Year!

55
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,992
Oh, it's good!

56
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,544
Toshimo Torito, dance, dance, dance!

57
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:11,286
Dance, dance!

58
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,990
Okay.

59
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,635
Do you two remember Tony's dance?

60
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,079
Yes, we do.

61
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:16,199
Okay.

62
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,365
Let's dance together.

63
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:18,846
Okay?

64
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:19,648
Okay.

65
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:20,871
Come on!

66
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,814
Come on!

67
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,641
Come on!

68
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:30,102
And... Peace!

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,934
Fieber.

70
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:34,851
Fieber.

71
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,012
Fieber.

72
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,825
And... Oh, God!

73
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,880
And then...

74
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:50,881
OK. One, two, three.

75
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:51,163
OK.

76
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,153
Happy New Year!

77
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,449
Tony's birthday is January 1st.

78
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,617
It's the 26th of this year.

79
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,126
How old are you?

80
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm 26 years old.

81
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:11,095
I was born on January 1st.

82
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,723
I was born and raised by my parents.

83
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:17,925
You're not going to talk to me like that.

84
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:20,080
When is your birthday, Rouga?

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,205
It's today, January 5th.

86
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:22,811
Oh, it's today!

87
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,241
Today is January 5th.

88
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:25,924
That's right.

89
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,397
It's today, right?

90
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:28,800
Phoebe!

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,646
Phoebe.

92
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,185
You don't understand at all, do you?

93
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,205
Exactly.

94
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,249
Happy birthday.

95
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,273
Come on.

96
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,619
Happy birthday.

97
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:39,321
Come on.

98
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,727
To you.

99
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:42,454
Happy birthday.

100
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:42,715
To you.

101
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:48,739
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

102
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:53,886
To you… Au revoir!

103
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:55,943
I've got an idea!

104
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,893
I've got an idea!

105
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,019
Mikan Seijin has appeared.

106
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:21,975
Happy New Year!

107
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:22,978
Ugo Ugo Luga!

108
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:29,892
This is a great plan!

109
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:30,977
A great plan!

110
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:31,601
A great plan!

111
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:31,922
A great plan!

112
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:43,347
In 1990, Harapoko, a mysterious man who came to Tokyo, discovered the most delicious tonkatsu and shumita in this town.

113
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,902
Hey, I'm coming.

114
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,709
I'm coming.

115
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,316
I'm coming.

116
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,683
Oh, that's right!

117
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:53,164
I was wrong!

118
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:54,228
Oh, that's fine!

119
00:06:54,308 --> 00:07:00,205
On the way there, the old man comes to his senses.

120
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:11,055
Every time I see something delicious, I scream with joy that I'm happy.

121
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:18,688
Don't say that, you idiot!

122
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,160
It's so good!

123
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,125
Let's eat!

124
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:27,142
Finally, the time has come to eat Tonkatsu.

125
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,489
What is the taste of Tonkatsu?

126
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,197
And what is the true identity of Daisaku?

127
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,423
Let's find out.

128
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:39,512
Wow!

129
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:43,087
It's so good!

130
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,185
Wow!

131
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,755
Okay.

132
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,660
Bye-bye!

133
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:02,625
Whoa!

134
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,972
I'm waiting for you!

135
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,198
I'm waiting for you!

136
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm waiting for you!

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,364
I'm waiting for you!

138
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:18,147
I'm waiting for you!

139
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,032
I'm waiting for you!

140
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:19,775
I'm waiting for you!

141
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:20,378
I'm waiting for you!

142
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,985
Apple Jojo!

143
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,925
Let's change the year and say it while we're at it!

144
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,901
I am the master of one country and one city.

145
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:31,844
Well, I am the lord.

146
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:36,038
The lord is always at my pace.

147
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,884
Thank you for watching

148
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,892
Thank you.

149
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:35,218
Morning Literature Red and Black, Episode 2

150
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:43,082
A few days later, rumors spread that Julian and Mrs. Renard had an affair were spread all over the town.

151
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:52,718
Eventually, the rumor spread so widely that anyone who lives in the city knows it, so Julian had no choice but to move to a town called Busanseon and enter a new school there.

152
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:56,008
He fixed it with his power.

153
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,894
He was very good at it.

154
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,940
He was recommended by the Pirar god of the palace.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,645
He was the great king of Paris, King Lamour.

156
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:10,302
I'm sorry, but I have something to tell you.

157
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,734
I don't have enough money to build a castle.

158
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:18,587
There is nothing else to talk about.

159
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:22,767
Can you lend me some of your money?

160
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,552
I got it!

161
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:25,202
No!

162
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:29,306
Because I left it in the bank.

163
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,372
You left it in the bank?

164
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,745
It's pretty hard.

165
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm fine.

166
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,981
How much will you lend me?

167
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:37,387
One yen.

168
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:37,830
What's that?

169
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,799
No way.

170
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:45,790
Anyway, if you don't give it to me, how are you going to use it?

171
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:55,149
That's why I entrust it to my mom and ask her to take it to the bank.

172
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,252
Does Ruga buy anything?

173
00:10:56,232 --> 00:11:02,260
Because I can only understand 110 years.

174
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,491
But I can do this.

175
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:11,136
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.

176
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:20,063
36, 45, 54, 57, 63, 72, 81.

177
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:25,699
Everyone, don't say it.

178
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,627
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

179
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:42,979
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

180
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,468
That's right.

181
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,502
It's easy, isn't it?

182
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:52,783
That's right.

183
00:11:54,164 --> 00:12:02,571
Happy New Year!

184
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:06,268
Yeah.

185
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,326
One, two, three.

186
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,453
Ooga, ooga, looga.

187
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,499
Happy New Year!

188
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:16,932
Oh, shit.

189
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:23,867
Good luck this year, Asao-kun!

190
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:34,701
you

191
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:46,183
Finally, please teach me the words of my country for the New Year.

192
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:47,609
Today's word is 毎度.

193
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,353
Say it.

194
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,154
That's right.

195
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:50,877
Mild coffee is deep.

196
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,363
We sell mild coffee.

197
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:57,887
We don't sell mild coffee.

198
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:03,262
It's delicious because it's coffee.

199
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,249
Then let me drink it this time.

200
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:05,727
I'm going to cry.

201
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:11,756
Come to my house and show me around the house.

202
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,243
I'm looking forward to it.

203
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,895
Anyway, MAIDO is a convenient word.

204
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:19,572
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, thank you for your help.

205
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,456
How are you doing?

206
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,947
Everyone is included in MAIDO.

207
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,256
It's convenient to say hello to everyone.

208
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:27,239
Hello.

209
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:28,082
Hello.

210
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:29,064
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:32,093
It's the beginning of the new year and you're acting well.

212
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:34,160
Now it's time to go home.

213
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:35,244
I'm going home.

214
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,135
See you next time.

215
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:41,667
See you next time.

216
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:41,948
Bye-bye.

217
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:47,989
It's the beginning of the new year!

218
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,867
Hey!

219
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:54,169
Hey!

220
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:54,572
Hey!

221
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:55,056
Hey!

222
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:55,297
Hey!

223
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,747
Hey!

224
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:56,848
Hey!

225
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:03,799
We're going to be blown away to Mexico!

226
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:03,919
Help!

227
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,265
Who are you?

228
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,356
Shokutan Zenkai Bari Bari Pararira Pararira

229
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,291
It's getting colder in the new year.

230
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,182
Do you know what you should do if you can't get out of the bed in the cold morning?

231
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,011
Take a bath in the bed.

232
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,877
What?

233
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,040
Take a bath in the bed.

234
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,442
Here you go, Ryuga-chan.

235
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:41,905
I'm going to wake up.

236
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,973
Do you wake up early in the morning?

237
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:46,134
Yes.

238
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:46,899
That's a good thing.

239
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,267
Yes.

240
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,411
That's right.

241
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,177
Let's wake up early and do a lot of fun things.

242
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:56,115
Today, too, we'll see the fastest Ugo-Ugo-Roo and get off the bus.

243
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:56,838
Bye-bye!

244
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,801
Bye-bye!
