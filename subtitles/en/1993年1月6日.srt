1
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,743
This way.

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,753
Good morning.

3
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,397
Good morning.

4
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,508
Today's word is, congratulations.

5
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,981
Congratulations.

6
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:17,453
On New Year's Day, or at a wedding, or at a celebration like that, right?

7
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:17,654
Yes, yes.

8
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:18,216
Well then, congratulations.

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,215
Oh, I got it!

10
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:26,822
Congratulations!

11
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:37,673
Omedetai-hito means a person who is good at everything.

12
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:42,687
So even if you're called a happy person, you can't be happy.

13
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,090
Got it?

14
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,577
Yes!

15
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,924
Well then, today too, let's have a happy, cheerful, and joyful day!

16
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,009
Happy, joyful, and joyful day!

17
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:51,612
Yes, well done!

18
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,176
Who are you?

19
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:02,293
Nekitoros Torotoros Torotoros Torotoros Torotoros Torotoros

20
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,537
Good morning, everyone.

21
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:20,278
Mr. Shuu Tomijoku!

22
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:21,042
Let's make Chinese food!

23
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:26,813
Today, let's make fried eggs and noodles.

24
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:33,951
The ingredients are eggs, flour...

25
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:41,882
First, break the egg into a bowl and cut the bottom into small pieces.

26
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,018
Then, season with salt, pepper, soy sauce and sesame oil.

27
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,269
Make sure it's well seasoned.

28
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,260
Mix the eggs well.

29
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,897
Put oil in a frying pan.

30
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:04,174
Pour the egg into the pot and stir it with a spatula.

31
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:08,694
The point is not to fry it too much, but to make it look raw.

32
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,612
Don't fry it too much, just make it soft and fluffy.

33
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:18,417
The soft part is the best part.

34
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:23,142
If it's too difficult for you, you can ask your mother.

35
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,596
Mikan Seijin has appeared.

36
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,260
Hi.

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,784
Good morning.

38
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,269
Good morning.

39
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,953
Good morning, my cute children.

40
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:54,856
How are you?

41
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:55,457
Thank you.

42
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:56,901
Thank you.

43
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:57,904
How are you?

44
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,853
Wait a minute!

45
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:03,372
What?

46
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,192
I made a mistake.

47
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,135
Wait a minute.

48
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:08,798
What's wrong?

49
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,019
I said kiki even though it was Karta.

50
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,501
What was I saying?

51
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,344
You forgot, didn't you?

52
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:15,505
No.

53
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,508
Do you want to try again?

54
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:20,930
No.

55
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,208
I forgot to say thank you in French.

56
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:27,434
Ah, it's Merci, isn't it?

57
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:28,758
Ah, yes, yes.

58
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,142
Say it again.

59
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,047
What was the first thing you said?

60
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,290
Good morning!

61
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,995
Good morning, my cute children!

62
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,396
Merci beaucoup.

63
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,492
Merci beaucoup.

64
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:49,305
By the way...

65
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:52,976
Happy New Year.

66
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,599
It's better to leave the yearbook at the bank or post office than to leave it to your mother.

67
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:08,642
Happy New Year.

68
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:12,694
We wish all the children prosperity New Year.

69
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:16,254
Peace, love and happiness.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,044
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,412
We love Japan.

72
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,558
Thank you.

73
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,182
Happy New Year!

74
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:32,978
Uga Uga Luga!

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,926
Mr. Harako Kozai, a mysterious man who came to Tokyo in 1995.

76
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,170
He was about to eat freshly fried tonkatsu.

77
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,198
Go!

78
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:49,500
Go!

79
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,996
Go!

80
00:05:54,338 --> 00:06:02,593
Five minutes after he starts eating, all the bones in the store disappear into his nose.

81
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,747
What is this?

82
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:13,005
It's a gift from my mother.

83
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:17,982
The plan was to put oranges instead of money to show how delicious the restaurant's food was.

84
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:22,658
In other words, instead of Michelin stars.

85
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,929
Don't worry about the tangerines.

86
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:26,954
Pay for the money.

87
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:30,008
I can eat more tangerines than money.

88
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,635
What did you say, idiot?

89
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,858
I don't have any money, so I won't take it.

90
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:43,380
The story continues in the next episode.

91
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:47,146
Hinshun, Kimete Kimete.

92
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,055
Kessho.

93
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:55,513
If you were to give up your savings, which would you choose, the bank or your mom?

94
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,657
The bank!

95
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:58,385
Mom!

96
00:06:58,927 --> 00:06:59,007
Mom?

97
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,980
Mama is a little dangerous.

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,997
Shure used to say to Mama,

99
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:08,474
I gave you all the money, but you took it all.

100
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,850
So you'd better not give it to your mother.

101
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:12,372
Why?

102
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:16,019
It seems like my mother used all of them for her clothes.

103
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,228
Let's move on to the next question.

104
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,420
Luka's mom doesn't do such things.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,665
Luka's mom is very kind.

106
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,354
Is that okay?

107
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,806
Oto no Hakubu-san!

108
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:52,129
Thank you.

109
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:06,821
.

110
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:06,861
.

111
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:16,467
.

112
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:16,507
.

113
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:16,547
.

114
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:24,681
Morning Literature!

115
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:32,093
Akadokuro Episode 3 Julian started to live in Paris.

116
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:34,705
As he had more opportunities to meet rich and wealthy people,

117
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:39,717
From the time I lived in the countryside, I became a cool man that I could not imagine.

118
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:48,458
Mathilde, the daughter of Count Lamor, said, I'm beautiful, smart, and elegant, and I won't let you down

119
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:56,473
Even though she grew up in the countryside, she was very interested in Julian, who was full of confidence, and she gradually started to like him.

120
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:06,058
And when Mathilde gave birth to his child, he told his father, Rameau, that he would die if he didn't marry him.

121
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,020
It's time for the earthquake joke episode.

122
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:13,546
Here it is.

123
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,053
The anniversary of the collapse of Russia.

124
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:21,151
Soviet Union 1st anniversary.

125
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:21,954
Shibu-kun has collapsed.

126
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:23,260
Let's do it again.

127
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,916
Decide, decide, Jijin-neta-hen.

128
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,816
After all, the anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union is difficult.

129
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,311
Freedom and bread.

130
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,347
Which do you want?

131
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:40,508
Yes.

132
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:41,696
Free!

133
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,730
What about you, Ruga?

134
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,971
Free!

135
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:44,112
I see.

136
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:45,930
It was a clean decision.

137
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,351
What is a free-for-all?

138
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,359
A free-for-all is a paper for drawing.

139
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,866
I see.

140
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,991
Here we go.

141
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,296
Next.

142
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,582
La Questión.

143
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:01,234
Decide, Decide, Life.

144
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:02,178
I knew it.

145
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:02,640
Here we go.

146
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:08,709
Michael Jackson and a lot of lost people.

147
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,994
Which one is noisy?

148
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:10,335
Michael Jackson!

149
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:12,094
Michael Jackson.

150
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:14,615
How about you, Ugo?

151
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,410
I'm the same as Rika.

152
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:22,668
Michael Jackson does this, right?

153
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,752
Yes, he does.

154
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:24,595
It's very similar, right?

155
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,446
My name is Luka.

156
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:32,377
I live in Pasco and I live in Bagontawan.

157
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,749
That's what I do.

158
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:41,652
The king of the sea and the king of the night.

159
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:42,856
Which do you want?

160
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:43,278
Me!

161
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:43,579
Go ahead.

162
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:46,358
You don't know both, do you?

163
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,372
Tohkai Teio is the name of a horse.

164
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,662
It's the name of a horse racing.

165
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:56,556
The king of the night is the one who makes people go vui vui in the city of night.

166
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,309
He's like our producer.

167
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,279
Jo of the night!

168
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,006
Jo of the night?

169
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:06,478
Jo of the night might be another producer.

170
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,094
I'm sorry I left you alone.

171
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:14,349
But you might be good at playing at night.

172
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,262
Playing at night...

173
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,485
Yes.

174
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:21,415
The queen of the night.

175
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,326
The queen of the night.

176
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,209
It's very scary.

177
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,313
The queen of the night.

178
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,437
Excuse me, I dropped some money.

179
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,462
I love you.

180
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:36,920
Oh, a manzaishi who can't be put in.

181
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,929
The poster is messed up.

182
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:48,497
Happy New Year!

183
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:53,391
Thank you.

184
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:16,476
Boom, boom, boom.

185
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,703
Yeah.

186
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:29,993
Oh, yeah.

187
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,536
Good luck this year, Masao!

188
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,794
My first dream and my first love.

189
00:12:58,814 --> 00:12:59,237
Question!

190
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:04,150
My first dream is to see you on the second day of the new year.

191
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:08,569
My first love is to fall in love for the first time.

192
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:15,392
Which one makes you happy?

193
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:15,974
The first one.

194
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:16,656
Your first dream?

195
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:16,757
Yes.

196
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:20,027
What about you, Ugo?

197
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,873
It's a dream.

198
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:24,537
I see.

199
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:27,170
It's like you two don't understand at all.

200
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,080
Well, here we go.

201
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,241
I see.

202
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,186
Here we go.

203
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,479
Here's the last question.

204
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,265
La question dernière.

205
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,944
Osechi no datemaki to iitomaki-maki.

206
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,290
It's a song you promised to sing this year as well.

207
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,732
Please sing along.

208
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:49,168
I see.

209
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,079
So, Shuru will go back to France.

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,465
See you!

211
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:54,368
Ciao!

212
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,296
Ciao!

213
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:56,697
Bye-bye!

214
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:11,496
The real Sakamoto-san is here!

215
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:18,966
We're going to be blown away to Egypt!

216
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,702
The gay pyramid!

217
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,144
We're going to crash!

218
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,305
Who are you?

219
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,196
I'm from Finland!

220
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,012
You're so cute!

221
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,753
One last word that is appropriate for the new year.

222
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,040
Okay?

223
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,181
Okay.

224
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:46,528
A ship that is about to sail.

225
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:52,536
Yes, it means to do it to the end.

226
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:58,291
I'm sure a lot of new things will start this year, but let's do our best until the end.

227
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:58,512
Yes!

228
00:14:58,552 --> 00:14:59,895
Then, see you again today!

229
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:00,356
Bye-bye!

230
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:01,941
Bye-bye!

231
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:02,121
Bye-bye!
