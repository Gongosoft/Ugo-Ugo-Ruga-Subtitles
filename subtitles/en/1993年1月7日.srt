1
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:58,360
Good morning.

2
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,641
Good morning.

3
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,510
Good morning.

4
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,932
Good morning.

5
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:10,048
Are you planning to start something new this year?

6
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:16,281
What are you going to do?

7
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,326
I'm going to clean the house.

8
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,414
It's been a long time since you started cleaning.

9
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:24,149
Hajime ga daiji.

10
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,581
Hajime ga daiji.

11
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,712
Hajime ni shita koto ga zutto wari made eikyou suru no te nani wo suru ni mo

12
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:33,667
Let's think about it carefully before we do it.

13
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:34,710
Do you understand?

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,071
Yes.

15
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,579
Then, today, too, let's have fun and have fun!

16
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:38,702
Let's have fun and have fun!

17
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:43,444
Thank you for watching!

18
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:48,867
Who are you?

19
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:51,262
I'm the president.

20
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,235
I don't have money.

21
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:53,738
Trust me.

22
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:04,268
Good morning, everyone.

23
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:17,284
Let's make delicious yakisoba with everyone today.

24
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,637
How to make Kanto-style Yakisoba

25
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:28,686
The ingredients are steamed rice, bean sprouts, char siu, shrimp, and so on.

26
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:34,069
Steamed noodles, bean sprouts, fried shrimp, and shrimp.

27
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:36,499
First, fry the bean sprouts for a while.

28
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:42,825
Then, put it in a bucket and drain the water.

29
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:43,772
Fry the bean sprouts and cut them into slices.

30
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,501
Then, heat the frying pan well.

31
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:53,026
Add char siu, bean sprouts, soba, and other ingredients.

32
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,572
Add them all at once and stir-fry well.

33
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,656
The seasoning is salt, pepper and soy sauce.

34
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:02,107
The point here is oyster sauce.

35
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:05,442
It's the oil from the catty.

36
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,294
If you add a bit of it, it'll be even better.

37
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,118
It'll be even better.

38
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:12,316
Add oyster sauce.

39
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:15,514
This is Cantonese-style yakisoba.

40
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:20,492
If you find it difficult to use fire, ask your mother.

41
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,571
Mikan Seijin appears.

42
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:43,761
Ken-dama!

43
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:45,207
Ken-dama!

44
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:48,139
Ken-dama!

45
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,324
Ken-dama!

46
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,188
Ken-dama!

47
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:50,971
Ken-dama!

48
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:51,172
Ken-dama!

49
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:51,373
Ken-dama!

50
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:51,694
Ken-dama!

51
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:59,237
Happy New Year!

52
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:05,312
Since it's a new year, I'd like to tell you two something.

53
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,250
Up until last year, I was kind of weak-willed.

54
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,117
I always listened to their facial expressions.

55
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:17,713
It was a bad robot, wasn't it?

56
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,242
That's how it breaks.

57
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,328
That's right.

58
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:20,972
It breaks right away.

59
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:25,781
But from this year onwards, I'll always be proud of myself.

60
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,874
I'll always be strong and brave.

61
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:32,053
I'm thinking of becoming a Terminator-like robot.

62
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,303
Terminator!

63
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:34,726
Right?

64
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,458
Do I look strong?

65
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,446
You're weak!

66
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,672
Happy New Year.

67
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:53,895
If your friend asks how much you got from your friend, you should give him a small amount.

68
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:06,016
Hello, Hugo Hugo Luga is very happy to wish you a great year.

69
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:06,197
Goodbye.

70
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:18,600
It's been an hour since Daisaku and the others met.

71
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,195
There is a young man.

72
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:28,742
He is a young man who admires Nankishin and photographer Shinoyama Kishin.

73
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,040
What's wrong, Asuka?

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,092
I'm busy, so please go home.

75
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,161
I'll go home then.

76
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:40,622
Not you.

77
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:49,212
As soon as they got in, they started talking.

78
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:52,111
There's no one, Yumi.

79
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:56,653
I'm sorry, but you're a great person to eat all the tonkatsu in the store by yourself.

80
00:05:57,477 --> 00:06:05,530
Daishaku was praised as a great man, and he hugged him and kissed him many times.

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,187
I'll leave it to the police.

82
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,754
Wait a minute.

83
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:13,225
I'll replace the amount he ate with this number.

84
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,775
Who is this woman who suddenly appeared?

85
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,401
And what will happen to Daisaku?

86
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,413
The mystery calls the mystery and continues in the next episode.

87
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:28,547
Now it's time to play with the robot.

88
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:32,697
This year, the order has changed.

89
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:37,474
Today, we're going to do something like a festival.

90
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,506
That's right.

91
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,523
It's a good year.

92
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:42,148
Let's go!

93
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:47,914
I drew 20 pictures in the morning.

94
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:48,075
I see.

95
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:50,046
How many did you draw in the afternoon?

96
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:53,697
I don't know how to do it.

97
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:57,613
I'm tired, so I'll do 10.

98
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:58,718
That's not it.

99
00:06:58,738 --> 00:06:59,682
I don't know how to do it.

100
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,725
This is it.

101
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:07,725
7 pieces.

102
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,617
Huh?

103
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:11,506
Why?

104
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:12,650
I don't know.

105
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,522
The two of us.

106
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,872
5 x 5 is 25.

107
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,916
25 pieces.

108
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:19,780
5 x 5 is 25.

109
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,545
5 x 5 is 25.

110
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,787
That's what I'm saying.

111
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,188
Morning Literature!

112
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,013
Red and Black, Episode 4

113
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:41,497
It can't be helped because it's a cute daughter's wish.

114
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:46,375
Ramor, who allowed Mathilde and Julian to get married, even gave him a great job as a guard.

115
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:54,863
But immediately after that, a letter from Lady Renard, who had written about Julian, was delivered to the Duke, and the dream of Julian's birth disappeared.

116
00:07:54,843 --> 00:08:02,760
When he returned to his hometown, he fired a pistol at Lady Renard, who was praying in the church, and was arrested on the spot.

117
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,519
I learned how to draw fish.

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,118
What kind of fish is that?

119
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:13,888
It's the sound of a fart.

120
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:17,406
I'm not going to teach you.

121
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:17,547
Fart.

122
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:17,828
Fart.

123
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:18,994
This is the hint.

124
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,962
I'm going to fart.

125
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,410
I'm going to fart.

126
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,718
What?

127
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,795
I don't know.

128
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,924
Boo Boo Boo!

129
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:33,186
Boo Boo Boo!

130
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,024
Eh, eh, bu?

131
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:35,768
Bu?

132
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:36,270
Buta?

133
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:39,144
That's not it.

134
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,697
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

135
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:42,239
No more.

136
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:42,822
No more.

137
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:52,693
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...

138
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:59,322
The answer is... What?

139
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,074
You're not the one who said it.

140
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:02,295
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,703
No way!

142
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:04,930
No way!

143
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,344
Robot-kun is coming.

144
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:08,691
Robot-kun is so excited today.

145
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:16,554
When I turned around, he stood up.

146
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:17,298
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,445
I was too nervous.

148
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,160
I'll do it one more time.

149
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,591
If you turn around, you'll stand up, but if you stop, you'll fall asleep.

150
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,065
I got it!

151
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,653
My heart!

152
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:40,727
Luka?

153
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:46,778
Yes, Luka-chan.

154
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:51,713
Why?

155
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,307
What's the reason?

156
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,634
I got it!

157
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,162
It's because of my father.

158
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:57,443
Your father?

159
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,713
I got it!

160
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,358
I got it!

161
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:03,802
Koma!

162
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,779
Correct!

163
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,912
I thought you knew.

164
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,782
Did I say something weird?

165
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,094
You know, when you do this,

166
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:25,084
It doesn't make any sense.

167
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:29,966
It's not connected, is it?

168
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:33,403
On the same day,

169
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:40,126
He went too far and got scolded.

170
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:44,423
Happy New Year, Ugo Ugo Luka.

171
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:45,667
Ugo!

172
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:49,138
One, two, three.

173
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:50,682
Ugo, Ugo, Lugo!

174
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,769
Happy New Year!

175
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,130
Hooray!

176
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:19,759
Boom, boom, achi gato boom Oike no mawari ni nobara ga seetayo Boom, boom, boom, achi gato boom

177
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,392
Yeah.

178
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,220
Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:34,086
Oh, yeah.

180
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,491
Good luck this year, Masao!

181
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:45,949
Hey.

182
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:51,452
Yeah.

183
00:11:56,695 --> 00:12:00,872
What do you eat when you get on a boat?

184
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:05,912
What do you eat when you get on a boat?

185
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:10,464
I won't give you a hint.

186
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,813
A mochi!

187
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,477
A bird!

188
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,665
Let's just say what we think.

189
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:26,545
Anyway, I'm in a good mood for the new year, so I'll be in your care from now on.

190
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,449
Yes!

191
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,256
Well then, bye bye!

192
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:29,638
Bye bye!

193
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,887
It's the beginning of the new year!

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,433
We're going to be blown away to France!

195
00:12:58,981 --> 00:12:59,886
Who are you?

196
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,671
Shabu-shabu-shabu-shabu-shabu...

197
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,718
It's related to Hajime, okay?

198
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:21,442
Yes.

199
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,676
Hajimehanbun.

200
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:25,982
Hajimehanbun.

201
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,087
That's right.

202
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,212
It doesn't mean anything at all.

203
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:31,801
Please don't do anything like that.

204
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:32,869
That's what I thought.

205
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,539
Everything depends on how you do it at first.

206
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:42,889
If you do it well, you'll be able to do half of it.

207
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:46,761
Let's do our best in the new year.

208
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:47,483
Yes.

209
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,321
See you later!

210
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,047
Bye-bye!

211
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:50,976
Bye-bye!
