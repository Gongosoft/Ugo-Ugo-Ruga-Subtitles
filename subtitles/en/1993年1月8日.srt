1
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:15,764
me too

2
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:43,251
Good morning.

3
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:43,954
Good morning.

4
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,158
It's upside down.

5
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:02,169
Good morning!

6
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:02,711
Good morning!

7
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:04,699
Friday is the day of breakfast.

8
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:05,844
I'll teach you the words of food, okay?

9
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:06,767
Okay!

10
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:08,293
Yaki-mochi wo yaku.

11
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:12,086
Yaku-pimochi wo yaku.

12
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:16,140
Do you understand?

13
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,682
Yes.

14
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,043
Here you go.

15
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:17,625
Please hold it in your hand.

16
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:32,644
We don't bake rice cakes that are too close or too far away.

17
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:38,183
To be envious of someone and to be rude to them.

18
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,428
Well then, today, let's have fun!

19
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:42,077
Let's have fun!

20
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:43,984
Good job.

21
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,891
Who are you?

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,890
You're so cool!

23
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,640
Good morning.

24
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:21,238
Today, let's make delicious fried rice with everyone.

25
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,122
How to make fried rice First of all,

26
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:29,226
Egg, white rice, rice, char siu, and sausage.

27
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:39,570
If you cook the bread well, the smoke will come out.

28
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,187
Then add the oil for the first time.

29
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:47,929
Add the eggs and fry until they become fluffy.

30
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:48,632
Next,

31
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:53,992
Add rice, green onions, and char siu.

32
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,682
It's easier to cook freshly cooked rice.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,675
Fry it until it smells good.

34
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,123
If it's difficult, ask your mother for help.

35
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:14,190
Today, we're going to make a delicious tea with a strong aroma.

36
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,202
Stir-fry well until the aroma comes out.

37
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:25,082
It's easy to make, so please try making it.

38
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:31,360
Mikan Seijin is here.

39
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,818
Thank you.

40
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:44,853
Friday is the day of breakfast.

41
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:46,563
You've been waiting for a long time.

42
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,817
Do you remember the spell?

43
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:49,803
I remember.

44
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:50,125
Say it.

45
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,403
Talk, talk, talk, talk, line up.

46
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,419
Yes, the TV is going first.

47
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,033
Welcome!

48
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,539
Let's eat!

49
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,406
Itadakimasu!

50
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,498
Today is a very delicious New Year's special.

51
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,903
I wonder what it is.

52
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:39,332
It's so good!

53
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:47,031
It looks like umeboshi, but it's umeboshi with umeboshi syrup.

54
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,440
Eat both.

55
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,451
How does it taste, Yuka?

56
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,300
It's good.

57
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,909
Who is Yuka-chan?

58
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:57,451
Excuse me.

59
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:00,765
She is a friend of Mr. TV.

60
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:01,970
Yuka-chan.

61
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,717
How do you feel, Yuka-chan?

62
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:07,194
It's pretty sour.

63
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,745
I thought it was sweet.

64
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:12,382
Please eat it with okayu.

65
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:18,445
Today's dish is Ugo Ugo Lugafu with Nanakusa Kayu.

66
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:19,107
What year is this?

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,752
Saru.

68
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,746
It's the year of the bird.

69
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:30,124
This year it's the year of the bird, so there's chicken in it, and the two of them are dressed in pio-pio.

70
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:33,214
Then if it's the year of the monkey, we'll put monkey meat in it.

71
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:35,141
You can't do that.

72
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:36,526
You can't eat monkey meat.

73
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,962
Yes, that's right.

74
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,006
Yesterday...

75
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:48,473
I ate chicken at school on Monday.

76
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:52,485
It was New Year's Day on Monday.

77
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:59,533
Did you eat chicken at school?

78
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:01,479
Yes.

79
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,863
What did you eat, Ruga?

80
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:13,613
You know, I ate a chicken leg from my school.

81
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:22,152
Yo!

82
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,969
If you're always in the mood for New Year's, it's going to be tough later on.

83
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:39,904
Happy New Year!

84
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:44,308
Thank you very much.

85
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:47,412
Ugo, Ugo, Luga.

86
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:53,691
Ugo, Luga, Luga, Happy New Year.

87
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:59,170
No, Daisaku!

88
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,136
No, Daisaku!

89
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:00,498
No, Daisaku!

90
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,082
No, Daisaku!

91
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,164
No, Nan-Ki.

92
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:04,455
We have to save the person in trouble.

93
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:07,731
She is the female reporter of Nico Nico Times, Sumiko Yamada.

94
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,831
I'm sorry for the interruption.

95
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,591
No, it's okay to thank me.

96
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:20,978
The reason she came here is to introduce this tonkatsu restaurant to you.

97
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:26,852
However, it is said that the tonkatsu here has been eaten up by the great work.

98
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:26,952
Wow!

99
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:30,105
I'll give him a surprising voice.

100
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:32,073
You're really great, Fuji-chan!

101
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,820
Wait!

102
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,953
Suzy decided to introduce this tonkatsu restaurant as a restaurant where you can eat a lot of delicious cabbage and rice.

103
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:48,694
Daisaku is eating a mountain of cabbage and rice one after another.

104
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:49,378
Otsu is so good!

105
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,589
It's so good!

106
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:58,963
Suji was so impressed that he invited Suji to go to all the stores in Tokyo.

107
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:05,274
Kyon's plan to make two friends was to make Tokibo proud that he would keep eating.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,485
The End.

109
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,920
Nanakusagai, was it good?

110
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,786
It was good.

111
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,510
How about greetings?

112
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:14,792
It was good.

113
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:20,940
Do you remember the spell to go back to your room?

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,125
Yes, I do.

115
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:22,606
Say it.

116
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,356
We will go back to the TV.

117
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,391
Peek-a-boo!

118
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:28,996
Peek-a-boo!

119
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:29,642
Peek-a-boo!

120
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,501
Go!

121
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:41,679
Go!

122
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:43,188
Go!

123
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:43,268
Go!

124
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:43,791
Go!

125
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:43,872
Go!

126
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:43,952
Go!

127
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,541
Good morning!

128
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:51,613
Good morning, Ogurt!

129
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:03,545
You're going to get a lot of nosebleeds this year, too.

130
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,560
This year's goal is to be in a good tempo.

131
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,914
Did you understand?

132
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:11,982
I don't understand.

133
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:23,929
Oto no Hakubu-san!

134
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:09,376
Morning Literature!

135
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,039
Red and Black!

136
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,723
The Final Episode

137
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:19,853
Julian, who was arrested, sincerely regretted what he had done so far, and met Mrs. Renard, whose wounds had healed, and felt happy again.

138
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,671
On the day of the trial, Julian was told that it was all your fault.

139
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,997
Julian was told that it was all your fault.

140
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:26,444
Julian was told that it was all your fault.

141
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,594
Julian was told that it was all your fault.

142
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:36,146
After that, Mathilde held Julian's neck and held a grand funeral, and Lady Renard hugged the children and left this world.

143
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,251
The End.

144
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:43,364
This year, 1993... What's that?

145
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,161
This year, this year...

146
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,186
This year, 1999...

147
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:51,409
One, two, three.

148
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,852
It's 1993 this year!

149
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,137
So what?

150
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:56,960
You don't know?

151
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,426
Of course I do!

152
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,454
That's embarrassing!

153
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,222
I know.

154
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,630
You do?

155
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:07,754
Now?

156
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,801
This year.

157
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:10,724
This year?

158
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:11,727
Like next year?

159
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:15,608
Last year was 1992.

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,610
So, this year is 1993.

161
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,092
Yes.

162
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:19,273
Okay?

163
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:19,876
Yes.

164
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,572
Okay, here's the question.

165
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:24,315
Yes.

166
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:31,015
What do you want to do the most this year, 1993?

167
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:35,689
Hey, Rouga-chan.

168
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,085
I want to keep playing Go!

169
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:39,466
Go!

170
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:39,607
Rouga.

171
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:40,752
Because it's fun.

172
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:41,818
I see.

173
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,607
The next one is a series of places I've been to.

174
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:52,365
It's the scariest place I've ever been to.

175
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:52,526
See?

176
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,378
It's the scariest place you've ever been to.

177
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:59,432
What kind of place was it?

178
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,742
A haunted house.

179
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,385
A haunted house?

180
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,268
I'm scared.

181
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,956
There is a good place.

182
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,865
Wait for me, Ruga.

183
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:12,375
The place where my mother got angry.

184
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:18,366
Manzai Shibuya-bou

185
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,536
I lost all my work.

186
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,487
What should I do?

187
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:26,027
The end.

188
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:27,232
One, two, three, go.

189
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,260
Lugo Lugo Hookah.

190
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:30,525

Heal the world.

00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,821
We'll heal the world together.

00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,918
Ooga, ooga, looga.

We love all the children.

00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,664
Peace.

205
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:00,908
Goodbye.

206
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:03,422
Thank you.

207
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:26,541
Boom, boom, achi gato boom

208
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:28,853
Yeah.

209
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,864
Oh, yeah.

210
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:40,648
Oh, yeah.

211
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:53,997
Good luck this year, Masao!

212
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:16,143
Which is your favorite store you've been to so far?

213
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,360
The U-Ga's store.

214
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,727
It's a paper shop.

215
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,169
Where is it?

216
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:39,950
What about you, Ugo-go-kun?

217
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,635
Well, I want to go to Yurakucho.

218
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,162
A store.

219
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:44,488
What's a store?

220
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,706
It's next to a toy store.

221
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,037
What kind of store is it?

222
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:51,338
A restaurant.

223
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:54,266
Is it good?

224
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:54,688
Yes.

225
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,138
What did you eat?

226
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,468
Well, I'll teach you.

227
00:14:59,489 --> 00:14:59,609
Ta-da!

228
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,754
What is that?

229
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:07,119
If you forget, you'll say it's a secret.

230
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,069
I won't tell you, Jean.

231
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,111
Yeah, look at that.

232
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:15,747
It's a secret again.

233
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,362
It looks like you're angry.

234
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:22,067
I'm not angry.

235
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,497
Well then, that's all for today.

236
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:28,302
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,791
Well then, bye bye!

238
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:30,032
Bye bye!

239
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,247
It's the beginning of the new year!

240
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:41,462
We're going to the Lingerie Pub!

241
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,125
We're going to the Lingerie Pub!

242
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:42,909
We're going to the Lingerie Pub!

243
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:43,853
We're going to the Lingerie Pub!

244
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,111
Who are you?

245
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,327
I'm a student from Kamata!

246
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,764
Lastly, can I teach you another word that comes with the word mochi?

247
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:15,985
Yes!

248
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,311
It comes with the word shirimochi.

249
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,295
You know this one, right?

250
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,902
You get it, right?

251
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:20,304
Yes!

252
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:21,369
Here you go.

253
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:25,568
If you fly from the stairs, you'll get a shirimochi.

254
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:28,699
We'll put it on.

255
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,703
We'll put it on the butt.

256
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,348
We'll put it on the butt.

257
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:34,680
You two slide on the snow and don't put it on the butt.

258
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,904
See you next time!

259
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,663
Bye-bye!

260
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,798
See you next week!
