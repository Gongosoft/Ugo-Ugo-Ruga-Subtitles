1
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:10,092
I don't have any words from the TV today.

2
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:12,327
Instead, I've taught you so far.

3
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:21,220
If you remember a word, please say it.

4
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:26,383
What does Ochanoko-saisai mean?

5
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:33,447
Here you go.

6
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:34,271
What about you, Luka?

7
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:35,217
I can see a smile on your face.

8
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:35,800
What does that mean?

9
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,494
You know, when you're embarrassed, your face turns red.

10
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:40,776
That's right.

11
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:40,997
Well done.

12
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:51,010
Let's learn a lot of new words from now on, okay?

13
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,551
Okay!

14
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,818
Let's do our best, Udonge-kun!

15
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:53,918
Yes!

16
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,860
Well then, today, let's have fun and have fun!

17
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,442
Let's have fun and have fun!

18
00:01:55,422 --> 00:02:00,169
Yes, you did a good job.

Mikan Seijin appears.

20
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:11,828
Now I am, I am, I am...

21
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:41,680
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:52,053
Okay, let's start with the usual warming up.

23
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:54,700
Let's start with come on.

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,586
Come on!

25
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:58,150
Okay, and feel.

26
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,933
Fever.

27
00:02:58,953 --> 00:02:59,294
Fever.

28
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,158
Fever.

29
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,262
And peas.

30
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,526
And peas.

31
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,514
And peas.

32
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:04,995
And peas.

33
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:05,337
And peas.

34
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:05,919
And peas.

35
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,043
And peas.

36
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay!

37
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:18,045
But today, Tony will use the acting that he's learned from the two of them, and make them laugh and have them act.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,048
Mikan Seijin appears.

39
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:44,629
We've been waiting for you.

40
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,279
The main event of the day.

41
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:47,701
RUO vs. RYUGA.

42
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:51,655
The winner of the comedy and acting battle.

43
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:52,538
Please give them a round of applause.

44
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,598
Please give him a big hand.

45
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,768
And the red corner, Uo-kun.

46
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:11,182
Let's move on to the first round.

47
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,955
First up is Luga-chan's Ah!

00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,018
Okay?

00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,745
Let's start with you, Ruka.

51
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:20,690
Start!

52
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:23,361
Okay, Roku-sama.

53
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,848
I did it.

54
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:25,591
That's all?

55
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,676
Oh, Roku-sama.

56
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:29,659
Oh, wait a minute.

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,186
Hello, Roku-sama.

58
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,661
Cabbage is cheap, isn't it?

59
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,946
Cabbage is cheap, isn't it?

60
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:34,628
Okay.

61
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,415

Uo-kun's father, please.

64
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,210
Uo-kun's father, please.

65
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,853
Why don't we do it at the same time?

66
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:48,336
Okay?

67
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,491
Let's get excited and go for it!

68
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,963
Luka-chan versus Ugo-kun!

69
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:57,205
You're going to get pecked!

70
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:00,325
You're going to get pecked!

71
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:04,645
Lula-chan wins with courage.

72

Mikan Seijin has appeared.

73
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,680
Mwahahahaha!

74
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:37,230
Hoon-da-ra-da Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra Hoon-da-ra

75
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,487
Hon-da-ra-ra-ta, hon-da-ra-ga-da-ra-da, ho-yee-ho-da.

76
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:42,840
Now, the second round.

77
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:47,322
Luga-chan's big laugh vs. Uo-kun's cry.

78
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:49,963
Let's do this at the same time, okay?

79
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,544
Ready, start!

80
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:52,705
Oh, no!

81
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:04,652
Okay.

82
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,435
This is a draw.

83
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,507
The third round will decide the winner.

84
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,545
Ryuga wins.

85
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:14,771
And one more.

86
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,334
Good luck, Uo.

87
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,786
That's it.

88
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:18,470
Let's go.

89
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,032
The third round.

90
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,168
Luka's Gero Tai.

91
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:26,593
Ugo-kun's Hanage Nuki.

92
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,641
Let's get into it.

93
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:29,705
Wait a minute!

94
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:30,488
What's that, Ugo-kun?

95
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,829
Oh, you're a flower.

96
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,881
That's a good one.

97
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,867
Go into the flower as hard as you can.

98
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,421
Did you get it?

99
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,991
Are you ready?

100
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,212
Okay!

101
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:46,886
Ugo-chan's Gero vs. Ugo-kun's Hanage Nuki.

102
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,476
Let's get it started.

103
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:50,400
Ready, go!

104
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,025
And how about you, Luka?

105
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:54,294
Luka's Gero.

106
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,538
And Ugo's Hanaginuki.

107
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:08,405
I'm sorry, but Uo won because of his inferiority complex.

108
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,937
So it's a one-on-one win.

109
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:22,142
I love you!

110
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:23,868
I love you!

111
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:25,292
I love you!

112
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,058
I love you!

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,981
I love you!

114
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:32,993
Okay, and cry, oh mommy, oh mommy, oh mommy, oh mommy.

115
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:38,730
And then... And then... And then...

116
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,660
Are you a new girl?

117
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:41,424
Yes, I'm a new girl.

118
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,435
Sayuri, what's your name?

119
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:44,118
You remember me well.

120
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:44,822
And call me Mama.

121
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,232
Call Mama Taxi!

122
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:48,436
OK, and then laugh!

123
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:53,395
And then, Naoki-sama!

124
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,686
So, smile as much as you can at the end!

125
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,744
Okay, okay.

126
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:00,769
That's it!

127
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:07,570
Okay.

128
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,645
See you next week!

129
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:11,417
Bye-bye!

130
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,115
Duriana, Duriana, wow!

131
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,994
Thank you, thank you!

132
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,536
Don't believe in rumors.

133
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,523
My heart is a poop.

134
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:40,594
It's always a fun dream.

135
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:48,272
Good morning!

136
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,982
We've been working really hard for a long time.

137
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:53,772
Thank you for your hard work.

138
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:58,228
You're going to be lonely.

139
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,023
I don't want to!

140
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:06,005
Thank you for your hard work!

141
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,771
That's not true, right?

142
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,003
You can do it from now on, right?

143
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,665
Mikan Seijin.

144
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,825
Well then, the three of us have sung various songs so far, haven't we?

145
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:41,732
Yes.

146
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:51,722
Today, if we just sing a song, it won't sound like a children's show, so I want to go back to the origin and sing a song like a school song.

147
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:55,789
Thank you for watching!

148
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,615
Good idea!

149
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:01,628
Do you know the song KAKKO?

150
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:01,829
I do!

151
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,573
I don't know it.

152
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:02,894
I know it.

153
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:03,838
Ugo-kun, can you teach me?

154
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:07,742
It's similar!

155
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,593
It's similar!

156
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:10,879
Is it true?

157
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:11,623
Is it different?

158
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:14,958
The one about the quiet meal?

159
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,405
I don't know.

160
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,334
From the shadows of the forest

161
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:21,681
How do I look?

162
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,818
You don't know?

163
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:28,637
I was going to do this with the three of us.

164
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,484
I don't know.

165
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:44,406
Mikan Seijin is back.

166
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:53,942
I'm in trouble, Tomato.

167
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:55,448
I'm in trouble.

168
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:58,902
What should I do when I'm invited to a date?

169
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:04,296
I wonder if it's still too early.

170
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,584
I wonder if I should try this.

171
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,954
What do you mean?

172
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:15,292
So, when the person in front of you says, don't worry, the person next to you says, don't worry.

173
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:15,372
Oh.

174
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:16,218
Okay?

175
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:17,829
Then, what's the order?

176
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:18,413
Okay.

177
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,145
Then... What?

178
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:21,413
You go first?

179
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:22,560
After that.

180
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:23,788
After that?

181
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,425
Then, Ungo-ungo will be number one.

182
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:31,372
Tomato goes in the second hole and Ruga goes in the third hole.

183
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:31,935
Do you understand?

184
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:32,860
Don't get in trouble.

185
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,765
Don't get in trouble.

186
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:38,562
Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble.

187
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:41,674
On a date, on a date, on a date.

188
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:42,878
I was invited, I was invited.

189
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,113
Let's try it!

190
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,590
Ready, set, go!

191
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,982
Don't get in my way!

192
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:57,660
Don't get in my way Don't get in my way

193
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,183
What should I do?

194
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:08,022
What should I do?

195
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:12,813
Is it still too early?

196
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,987
Is it still too early?

197
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:21,911
It's not over yet!

198
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,863
Now it's time for the next round.

199
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:34,144
Mikan Seijin appears.

200
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,414
Did it go well?

201
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,638
Yes, it did.

202
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:04,052
Then let's change the order.

203
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,420
Wait a minute!

204
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:05,903
What?

205
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:08,620
Then I'll teach you a new, true impression.

206
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,125
Do you understand?

207
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:16,686
For example, in this case, Ugongo-kun is always singing, saying, don't worry, invite me to a date.

208
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:24,482
And then, when Tomato said, "'Don't be in trouble'," Ugo Ugo-kun kept singing, saying, "'Don't be in trouble' again."

209
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,651
Ah, that...

210
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,878
I've heard of it somewhere.

211
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:29,159
Right?

212
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,944
Right?

213
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,248
Ah, it was in my class.

214
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,417
I did it in my class.

215
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,201
Then, let's practice what we did in the last lesson.

216
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:44,108
Okay.

217
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,146
Okay, this time it's Ruga-chan, Toma, and Ugogo-kun.

218
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,523
Ruga-chan will keep singing.

219
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:52,005
Okay.

220
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:56,266
Uwogawa-kun will sing the song, Tomato is in trouble.

221
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:59,321
Uwogawa-kun will sing the song.

222
00:13:59,341 --> 00:13:59,442
Okay.

223
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,527
Okay, Ryouga-chan will start.

224
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:09,859
One, two, three!

225
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,881
Thank you!

226
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:16,002
Thank you!

227
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,375
One more time!

228
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:19,958
One more time!

229
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:20,480
Let's do it again!

230
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,183
Let's do it again!

231
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:22,387
One, two, three!

232
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,070
It's Luka!

233
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:24,355
One, two, three!

234
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:28,791
Don't get in trouble.

235
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:31,782
Don't get in trouble.

236
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:32,384
Don't get in trouble.

237
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:32,826
Don't get in trouble.

238
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:39,484
I don't know!

239
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:39,745
Mikau Seijin

240
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:00,111
Next time, Ruga will do it first.

241
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,965
Ruga, go ahead!

242
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,610
Wait a minute!

243
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,995
1, 2, 3!

244
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,643
1, 2, 3!

245
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,930
I'm in trouble!

246
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:19,048
I'm in trouble!

247
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:19,831
I'm in trouble!

248
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:20,734
I'm in trouble!

249
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:33,863
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

250
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,705
I'll sing a song for you.

251
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:39,529
Okay, go ahead.

252
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:40,917
Wait!

253
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:49,505
Don't go on a date!

254
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,110
Don't go on a date!

255
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,953
Don't go on a date!

256
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,704
I did it!

257
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:56,712
I won!

258
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,508
Kamikaze Seijin Poyon!

259
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:09,934
See you later!

260
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:11,561
See you later!

261
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:12,405
See you later!

262
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:17,434
There's a school song called Kouka, right?

263
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:19,047
Can you sing it?

264
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:22,862
I can sing it, but...

265
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,332
I can only sing the middle part.

266
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:25,553
All right.

267
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,381
Ruga, you go first.

268
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:27,762
Go ahead.

269
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:39,186
One, two, three, four.

270
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:47,269
I want to go to elementary school.

271
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,191
That's great!

272
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:51,773
That's great.

273
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,219
Now it's Ugo-go's turn.

274
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,326
Let's go!

275
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:55,487
Yeah!

276
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,685
It's Ruka's debut!

277
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,777
That's it!

278
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:06,713
That's it!

279
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,857
That's it!

280
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:32,967
Gokushuu Shogakko!

281
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:40,054
Mikan Seiji, Dishonored

282
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,356
It's amazing.

283
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:58,476
Tomato sang too much last night, so she can't sing.

284
00:17:58,496 --> 00:17:59,038
Ruka jumped off,

285
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:02,244
That's right.

286
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,268
I'm tired.

287
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,434
I went to the gym today.

288
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:07,219
But it was pretty fun.

289
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:07,741
I'm tired.

290
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:10,108
I might be happy to be here.

291
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,566
Oh.

292
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,735
Right.

293
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:20,490
Well then, let's continue to be good friends from now on, okay?

294
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,731
Okay!

295
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,841
Well then, ciao ciao and kai ciao!

296
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:24,322
Ciao ciao and kai ciao!

297
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:24,503
Bye bye!

298
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,050
Mikan Seijin, Mishuo.

299
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,347
Mikan Seiji, Mishuou

300
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,312
Go!

301
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:15,774
Go!

302
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:21,439
Go!

303
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:25,911
Lastly, I'll teach you a saying to tighten your heart.

304
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:33,403
Tuna no ue no ie Tuna no ue no ie

305
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,028
That's right.

306
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,275
The sand is slippery, so when you build a house, you fall right away.

307
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:42,330
In other words, a house on the sand means you don't know when you're going to fall.

308
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,933
Ugo Goryuga could be a house on top of the sand.

309
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:46,174
No!

310
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:47,764
No?

311
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:48,709
You might be right.

312
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,719
Let's keep our hearts tight and do our best.

313
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:50,920
Yes!

314
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,448
That's all for today.

315
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:53,454
We'll see you next time!

316
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:54,700
Bye-bye!
