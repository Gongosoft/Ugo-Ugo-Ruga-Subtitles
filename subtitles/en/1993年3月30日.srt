1
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:43,646
Good morning.

2
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,530
Good morning!

3
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,812
It's slanted.

4
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:45,455
Oh, it's slanted!

5
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:45,917
It really is!

6
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,305
Good morning.

7
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,269
Good morning.

8
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,196
March is over, isn't it?

9
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,344
I'm looking forward to the live broadcast from April 5th.

10
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,332
It's the perfect time for that.

11
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:08,496
Are you ready?

12
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:09,058
Yes!

13
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,342
Hikkomi ga tsukanai.

14
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:12,148
Hikkomi ga tsukanai.

15
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,191
That's right.

16
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,398
When you get here, you have no choice but to do it.

17
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:18,268
Ugo and Luga don't like to be thrown out in the middle, do they?

18
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,308
They said they'd do a live broadcast next week, so they won't be able to do it.

19
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:25,371
Let's do our best.

20
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,660
That's all for today.

21
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,010
Have a good day!

22
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:31,615
Have a good day!

23
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:41,774
or trouble.

24
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:01,500
Not too much, sitting back

25
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,466
Hi!

26
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:12,463
Good morning!

27
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:13,827
Good morning!

28
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:14,388
Good morning!

29
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:14,689
Good morning!

30
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:16,314
Good morning!

31
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:16,735
Good morning!

32
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:17,397
Good morning!

33
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:17,939
Good morning!

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,581
Good morning!

35
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,062
Good morning!

36
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:19,423
Good morning!

37
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:19,945
Good morning!

38
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:26,003
In French, it's called Nouveau in Japanese.

39
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,869
It's not a candy, it's called Nouveau.

40
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,935
In Japanese, it's called Nouvelle.

41
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,101
Nubelberg?

42
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,428
Yes, Nubelberg.

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,128
There's Godard and Triforce.

44
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,662
We did it.

45
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:39,885
Well then, let's go.

46
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,412
Is it okay to decide?

47
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:43,595
Decide, Decide Special.

48
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:44,738
Ugo Ugo Lugahen.

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,523
Here we go.

50
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:49,455
Question 1.

51
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:55,905
Koi de yuuka and Koi de ikoka?

52
00:02:56,746 --> 00:03:01,313
Which word do Kansai people use on a date?

53
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:03,043
Koide yuka

54
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:04,397
The second one.

55
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,428
Let's say it's a boat.

56
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,253
It's a boat.

57
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:10,772
Now, the question is...

58
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:16,577
Asano Bun-gaku and Nasa no Ken-gaku.

59
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,947
Which do you prefer?

60
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:19,750
Asano Bun-gaku!

61
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:22,032
Do you understand?

62
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,680
Yes, I do.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,311
Do you understand the story?

64
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:26,673
Yes, I do.

65
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:27,055
No, I don't.

66
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,963
It's fine if you remember the author and the name of the work.

67
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,499
The questions are... Mikan Seijin and Tanaka Seijin.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,487
Who used to sing Beautiful Sunday?

69
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,062
Tanaka Seijin!

70
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,086
That's right.

71
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,211
Do you know him?

72
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,822
It's not Tanaka Seijin.

73
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:36,727
That's right.

74
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:37,310
They don't talk.

75
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,717
Well...

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,054
They only say, oh, oh, oh.

77
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:42,758
That's right.

78
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:44,466
Here we go.

79
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,812
Question.

80
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:49,508
Non-tan and Wan-tan.

81
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:53,434
Which will make you hungry?

82
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:53,736
Wonton!

83
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:56,733
Then, Non-tan or Pee-tan?

84
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:57,658
Which one?

85
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,286
Which do you prefer?

86
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:03,257
Pintan!

87
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:04,964
Which do you prefer?

88
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:06,228
Non-tan or Gyutan?

89
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:06,670
Gyutan!

90
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,854
I was a little persistent.

91
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:13,381
I like Masao-kun, the Pufferfish.

92
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,833
The Pufferfish and...

93
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,098
Momohiki's dad.

94
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:22,878
Which one do you want to be at home with?

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,002
Momohiki's dad!

96
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:24,906
Momohiki's dad.

97
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:25,970
I can do it!

98
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,211
Go ahead.

99
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:31,503
It's an imitation, isn't it?

100
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:31,603
Yes.

101
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,528
How about Michael?

102
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,162
Michael's toys.

103
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:35,644
He lives here.

104
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,605
It's a small igloo.

105
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,638
What about Momohiki's father?

106
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:43,626
Is he wearing a momohiki?

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,746
What is it?

108
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:51,762
It's a warm one that my father wears under his pants.

109
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:52,464
It's a very warm one.

110
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,408
It's a warm one, right?

111
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:53,869
Do you wear it?

112
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,141
It's open.

113
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:56,957
It's open?

114
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,904
It's a good family, isn't it?

115
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:02,536
It's probably a peaceful family, isn't it?

116
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,520
It's a good family.

117
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,850
It's a happy family with a dad with a peach tree.

118
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,686
My dad is also wearing it.

119
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:13,933
Is he wearing it and purring?

120
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,867
Your mother is wearing it too.

121
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:21,139
My mother?

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,763
She's not wearing it.

123
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,075
She's not wearing it.

124
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:27,797
Question 6.

125
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:33,499
You are happy with Tajima Hidetou, right?

126
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,314
Tajima Hidetou or Mito Natto?

127
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,844
Which is more famous in Ibaraki?

128
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:42,173
Tajima Hidetou!

129
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:48,598
Don't be shy!

130
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,589
Don't be shy!

131
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,952
What about school?

132
00:07:54,252 --> 00:08:00,351
What about you, Yuka-chan?

133
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:02,057
Not Yuka-chan, Ruga!

134
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:02,779
What about you, Ruga-chan?

135
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:04,043
What?

136
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,644
Are you famous for that?

137
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,961
You're shy.

138
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:09,947
Let's go.

139
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,003
Question set.

140
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:17,948
The one who is great at teaching and the one with a big butt.

141
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,662
Which one do you want to meet?

142
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:21,627
Which one do you want to meet?

143
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,441
The person who taught me!

144
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:25,790
The person who taught me!

145
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,281
Who has a big butt?

146
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:27,361
No!

147
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:27,482
No!

148
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,654
I don't like it.

149
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,524
I don't like it.

150
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,238
I don't like it.

151
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,565
I don't like it.

152
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,787
Question, you eat.

153
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,806
Oshigoto ippai hoi sassa to.

154
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,037
Oshigoto hontou ni ippai erai koccha.

155
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:43,256
Which one does the Uogoruga staff always go to?

156
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:43,357
Yes!

157
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:44,001
The first one.

158
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,107
You have a lot of work to do.

159
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,266
How about you, Hajima-kun?

160
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:47,791
It's hard, isn't it?

161
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,162
It's hard to prepare for the live broadcast, isn't it?

162
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:54,031
You two should do your best, okay?

163
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,132
Yes!

164
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:55,215
Then, Radio Nyaku Question.

165
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:00,908
Shuru-kun doesn't like it, but the director's time is running out.

166
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,455
And Ito-maki-maki

167
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,120
Which one do you like?

168
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,704
It's been a while.

169
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,718
I'd like to hear it.

170
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:08,040
Go ahead.

171
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,571
Rock, paper, scissors!

172
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,323
Rock, paper, scissors!

173
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,649
Rock, paper, scissors!

174
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:15,954
Rock, paper, scissors!

175
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,501
Rock, paper, scissors!

176
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:17,963
Rock, paper, scissors!

177
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,406
Angelica, you're so beautiful!

178
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:29,607
Angelica!

179
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:43,056
Ah, to have lived,

180
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:49,175
And that's it for this video.

181
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,363
Thanks for watching!

182
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:58,750
I love you.

183
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:13,642
I'm going home now.

184
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:14,708
See you later!

185
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:15,895
Bye bye!

186
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:25,451
Let's do it again.

187
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:25,753
Ready, go!

188
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:26,357
Kick!

189
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:36,533
Gompi-tabu-tabu, gompi-tabu-tabu!

190
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,863
Good morning!

191
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:41,691
How are you?

192
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:41,933
Good!

193
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:46,574
We've done a lot of things since we first met, haven't we?

194
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:51,214
But every single one of them was short-lived, wasn't it?

195
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:54,970
So, do you remember what you did?

196
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,191
Yes, I do!

197
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,597
What was the first thing you did?

198
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,360
Chiritori!

199
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:58,325
Chiritori!

200
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,293
You remember so well!

201
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:05,684
Then, how about our unknown name, Twinpix?

202
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:07,836
I know!

203
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,484
Tsuru!

204
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:12,630
Tsuru!

205
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:12,810
Ugo-kun!

206
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,724
Tsuru!

207
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:16,809
Tsumiki!

208
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,417
Tsuna!

209
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:22,769
It's a hornet, isn't it?

210
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:23,271
A hornet.

211
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:24,556
All right!

212
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:25,198
That's enough!

213
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,968
I guess I didn't live long enough to know!

214
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:39,072
Thank you.

215
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:48,287
All right.

216
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,156
I see.

217
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:28,269
Then, do you remember what you did after the game?

218
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:29,635
Me too!

219
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:29,896
Me too!

220
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,342
You guys really remember well.

221
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:31,603
Yes.

222
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:36,440
Alright, then let's do an if-and-if attack!

223
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,721
Okay!

224
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,006
First, I'll ask Ugo-go-kun.

225
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,207
Okay!

226
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:39,973
If...

227
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:45,390
If you take a day off, who do you want to play with?

228
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,804
You can think a little.

229
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,138
I'll think a little.

230
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:51,432
I see.

231
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,751
Okay, I'll ask Ruga too.

232
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:01,776
You know, Ruga said something about my mom.

233
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,686
I see.

234
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,923
That's a good idea.

235
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:11,955
Well then, I'll ask Luka-chan too.

236
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:17,371
If Ugo Ugo-kun had a day off, who would you like to play Ugo Ugo instead?

237
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:17,672
Ugo Ugo's dad!

238
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:18,996
Ow!

239
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:19,933
My thumb!

240
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:56,839
Maseo!

241
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:01,311
Do you remember what happened after the attack?

242
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:11,943
It's coming!

243
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,317
Wait a minute.

244
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:16,722
What is it?

245
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:18,028
What is it?

246
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,152
Did you do it?

247
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:19,654
I did it!

248
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:21,444
You're the worst!

249
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,849
The first attack?

250
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,572
That's right!

251
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:30,448
Let's start with the first attack!

252
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:30,769
Okay!

253
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:32,175
What is the best thing about playing Ugo Ogo Luga?

254
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:36,006
What is the best thing about Ugo-goro?

255
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,878
Don't you get it?

256
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:41,999
Yeah!

257
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,412
Did you get a lot of toys?

258
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,016
Yeah!

259
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:45,619
Yeah!

260
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,182
Alright!

261
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:47,147
See you later!

262
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:50,504
You know a lot, Oda-san!

263
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:50,926
See you later!

264
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:51,328
See you later!

265
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,307
Masao!

266
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,442
Do your best, Masao!

267
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:38,381
Well, well, and the last one is always the dissatisfied pig.

268
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,047
Dissatisfied pig, dissatisfied pig.

269
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:44,603
Why are we the only ones who have been reborn so many times?

270
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:49,058
I want a game like this.

271
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,935
My, my collector.

272
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:53,175
Eh?

273
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:06,279
What's a live broadcast?

274
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,408
It's about Google Earth.

275
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,713
What's a live broadcast?

276
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:17,088
You guys don't know either, do you?

277
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:17,951
Yeah.

278
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:19,838
I forgot to tell you earlier.

279
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:22,659
Babu!

280
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,930
Ah, that's right!

281
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,149
Director's...

282
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,992
If you make a mistake in the live broadcast,

283
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:35,295
I can't go.

284
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,120
I made a mistake.

285
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,189
If I make a mistake, I'll just take it.

286
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,709
Well, anyway...

287
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,190
Let's do our best!

288
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,511
Yeah!

289
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,161
Let's keep up the good work!

290
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:48,382
Yeah!

291
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:49,626
Alright, I'm going home now!

292
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,891
Okay!

293
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:51,694
See you!

294
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:52,035
Bye-bye!

295
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,060
E-bye bye bye bye!

296
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:10,818
you

297
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:30,932
Matzo!

298
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,205
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da!

299
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,062
One last thing.

300
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,546
It's perfect for the live broadcast starting on April 5th.

301
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:13,309
It's hard.

302
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:13,530
Yes.

303
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:17,324
If you do, you'll be saved.

304
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,789
If you do, you'll be saved.

305
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,832
That's right.

306
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:22,823
When a person is trapped and driven into a desperate situation,

307
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:27,358
but it also means that you'll be able to come up with good ideas.

308
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:27,799
Yes!

309
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,451
Before the live broadcast, it's hard for the staff members to feel this way.

310
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:31,632
Yes!

311
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:32,825
That's all for today.

312
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:35,048
We'll see you again on the live broadcast.

313
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,614
Bye-bye!
