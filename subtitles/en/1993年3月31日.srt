Good morning.

4
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:07,956
March is finally over.

5
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:11,680
Let's start with today's phrase.

6
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,968
Nishin-geppo.

7
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:19,532
It means that the world is progressing day by day.

8
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,397
This show, Go!

9
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,161
Go!

10
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:25,003
Luger, and Shingen, let's keep moving forward!

11
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,552
Yes!

12
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,446
Have a good day!

13
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:31,609
Have a good day!

14
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,475
Yes, good job!

15
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:34,203
Oya-jibushi!

16
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:36,358
Go, go, Luka!

17
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:37,445
We're moving at the last minute!

18
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:38,432
Dad!

19
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:45,030
Oh, my God!

20
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,129
Well, today, I'm going to repeat the Kansai dialect I've taught you, okay?

21
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,995
Okay!

22
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:54,961
Let's start with a simple one.

23
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:57,749
How do you say thank you in Kansai dialect?

24
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,612
Oukini.

25
00:01:58,712 --> 00:01:59,996
That's right.

26
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:00,558
Say Oukini.

27
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,122
Oukini.

28
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:02,985
That's pretty good.

29
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:07,986
The next one is a very important word.

30
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:11,018
It's used when someone asks you, are you making a profit?

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,942
Bocchi bocchi denga.

32
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:19,287
Bocchi bocchi denga.

33
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,050
Dengang.

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,119
Well, that's a close call.

35
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:24,925
Next.

36
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:26,169
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,353
Make yourself at home.

38
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,984
Don't worry about it.

39
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,036
I can't do it with you.

40
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:33,739
I'm glad to hear that.

41
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,221
I'm glad to hear that.

42
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:40,633
My heart is beating so fast.

43
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:51,113
One day, the son of a rich man goes to school in the morning.

44
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:57,660
One day, a rich man's son

45
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:04,073
You can study elegantly in the morning

46
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:13,557
A day of a son with a lot of money Lunch, a rich lunch

47
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:20,321
A day with a son with a lot of money.

48
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:24,593
F1 exchange in the garden in the afternoon.

49
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:32,490
A day of a rich man's son

50
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:37,886
Before you go to bed, use the money to buy flowers.

51
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:38,228
The end.

52
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,820
Are you ready?

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:42,981
Yes!

54
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,720
Are you ready?

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:46,901
Yes!

56
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,222
Let's go!

57
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:47,383
Yes!

58
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:47,765
Are you ready?

59
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:48,167
Yes!

60
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,884
I'm asking you to do me a favor.

61
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:54,090
Please do me a favor.

62
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,257
Say it again.

63
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:58,247
Yoroshuu-san-gomo.

64
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,373
That's it.

65
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:00,579
Yoroshuu-tanomo.

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,106
Yoroshuu-tanomo.

67
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:09,919
Ha-ha!

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,471
Well, it's like a snack, like a chakamashi roll.

69
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:14,997
Well, chakamasu.

70
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,383
Chakamasu.

71
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:17,547
Chakamasu.

72
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:22,662
It means, would you like some tea?

73
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,788
Would you like some tea?

74
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,693
I don't know how to explain it in Kansai dialect.

75
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,190
Come on, say it.

76
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,913
What do you want to say?

77
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,561
What do you want to say?

78
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:32,947
What do you want to say?

79
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:33,610
What do you want to say?

80
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:35,940
What do you want to say?

81
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,387
It's pretty scary.

82
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:45,576
There might be a scout, so be careful.

83
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,345
Immediately after they are born, they hatch.

84
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:51,907
To be continued.

85
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,718
A Life of a Hatch insect

86
00:04:56,305 --> 00:05:00,643

Next.

88
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:05,944
The life of a shaku-tori-mushi.

89
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,064
Dad, you can do it!

90
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:12,610
Good luck!

Life is full of shakus.

98
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:33,484
It's over.

99
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:40,429
What's that?

100
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,980
What's that?

101
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,484
Got it?

102
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,715
Then let's go and enjoy the world!

103
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:51,810
Okay!

104
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,655
That's right.

105
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:53,278
That's how you do it.

106
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,959
And from April, you have to do it more and more.

107
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:57,321
Okay?

108
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,252
More and more.

109
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:06,759
Especially next week, unlike Yatsuhashi, there will be a live broadcast.

110
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,703
Do you understand?

111
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:08,466
There will be no replay.

112
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,089
Right?

113
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:12,918
So, keep it tight.

114
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:14,989
Yes, sir!

115
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:15,793
I'm going home now.

116
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,140
Yes, sir!

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,565

118
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,515

128
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,455
Hello!

129
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:44,648
How are you?

130
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,038
I'm fine!

131
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:51,450
Today, it's not Nendo Zaiku, it's Nendo Matsu!

132
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,986
It's a special of Mr. Gamotto's NaZuNaZu!

133
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:05,520
One day, a snowman...

134
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:12,220
In the morning, the snowman wakes up and washes his face.

135
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:15,919
One snowman's day.

136
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:21,817
In the morning, the snowman is sent by his family to get the prey.

137
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,121
To be continued.

138
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,203
A snowman's day.

139
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,791
He's there.

140
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,600
He takes a break and eats a little lunch.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,769
To be continued

142
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:37,212

5.

144
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:46,984
He was caught by a human and ran away in a hurry.

145
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:47,164
Next.

146
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:47,325
6.

147
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,147
A snowman's day.

148
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:55,541
Yogi was scolded by his wife for not taking the prey.

149
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:55,943
The end.

150
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:59,110
Question 1.

151
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,490
What is the sport that has a slope even if it is flat?

152
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:08,026
Even if you play where you can't enter, there is a slope.

153
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,394
Saka!

154
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:10,219
Saka!

155
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,742
Saka!

156
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:15,180
Next!

157
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:21,289
What is the animal that is always angry even though it has a kind face?

158
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:24,120
Gorilla!

159
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,747
Gorilla?

160
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:26,269
Um...

161
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:27,836
Elephant!

162
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:28,097
Elephant?

163
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,382
You know all the animals.

164
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:29,824
Chimpanzee!

165
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,009
Chimpanzee?

166
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:36,180
Luka-chan, how do you get angry when people get angry?

167
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,545
I get angry.

168
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:40,477
What do you say when you scream?

169
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,079
KUYA!

170
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,361
That's right.

171
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:41,742
You got it right!

172
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,865
I got it!

173
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:48,654
Rock, paper, scissors!

174
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,861
You're in good shape.

175
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,305
Ugo-kun, you're a little slow.

176
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:53,915
Boss bug!

177
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:55,721
Gogoruga!

178
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:58,650
I think I should take my pants off.

179
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:02,262
What is it that you want to throw away even though you bought it?

180
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,622
It's not like that.

181
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:14,833
I bought it, but I thought I'd throw it away.

182
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,222
It's like a sticker.

183
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:20,765
A sticker?

184
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,178
No, it's not.

185
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,752
It's something like that.

186
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,273
Gum tape.

187
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:28,297
Gum tape?

188
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,733
No, that's not it.

189
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,439
Something to throw away.

190
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:35,202
Ah, something like this.

191
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,623
I wonder if he knows.

192
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:42,101
I wonder if he doesn't know.

193
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:42,864
Wait a minute.

194
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:43,487
Koo-san?

195
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:44,430
Koo-san?

196
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,892
Koo-san?

197
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:45,575
He's smiling.

198
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:46,137
Koo-san?

199
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,884
How is it?

200
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:48,567
Not yet.

201
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:48,989
Why not?

202
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,481
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

203
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,667
It's a sticky spring thing.

204
00:09:55,533 --> 00:10:03,315
That's right, that's right, that's right.

205
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:03,676
Harumono .

206
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:03,716
.

207
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:03,756
.

208
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:03,796
.

209
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:03,837
.

210
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:03,877
.

211
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:03,917
.

212
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:03,957
.

213
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:03,997
.

214
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:04,037
.

215
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:04,077
.

216
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:04,117
.

217
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:04,157
.

218
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:04,218
.

219
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:04,258
.

220
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:04,378
TAPE!

221
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:10,741
One day, a wicked man.

222
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:14,352
In the morning, he buys milk from someone else's house.

223
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:16,258
The bad guy continues.

224
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:21,778
One day in the middle of a dark night.

225
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:26,113
The story of a bad cat who bullies a stray cat continues.

226
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:31,271
One day in the middle of the night.

227
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,418
He goes to the dining room to get a dish.

228
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,087
The bad guy continues.

229
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:41,162
One day, a very bad person.

230
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:46,077
A bad guy who doesn't let his old man take his seat.

231
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:47,023
Mm-hmm.

232
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:52,696
A day of a very bad person.

233
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,284
At night, a bad guy who puts today's bad news on his diary.

234
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,771
The end.

235
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,288
Eh?

236
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,373
What did you say?

237
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,538
Tape!

238
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,186
Tape?

239
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,934
Which country's specialty product is it?

240
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:12,185
A dolphin.

241
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:16,047
A dolphin?

242
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:18,326
Uguisse!

243
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:20,194
Uguisse?

244
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:26,543
Eh?

245
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,470
I don't know.

246
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,495
I think I forgot the problem.

247
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,922
I'll say it again.

248
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,520
I bought it, but I want to throw it away.

249
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,380
Well, I'm going to throw this away.

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,913
I'm going to throw this away.

251
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,401
I'm going to throw this away.

252
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:48,178
Do you know the answer?

253
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,442
Anyone?

254
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:50,104
It's difficult.

255
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,368
Wait a minute.

256
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,796
I'll let you say it one more time.

257
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,266
What is it, Ryuga-chan?

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,643
A child.

259
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:07,532
Yes.

260
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:10,232
It's solidified.

261
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,095
It's solidified.

262
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,392
One day in the life of a manzaishi.

263
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,239
He's been practicing bokeh and tsukkomi since this morning.

264
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:29,166
Yatterarumahen is a story of a manzaishi who can't sell.

265
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:35,835
In the morning, I had to run to the top of the gag.

266
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:36,979
I can't do it.

267
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:44,995
One day, a manzaishi couldn't make money, so he couldn't eat lunch.

268
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:49,028
I can't do it.

269
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,987
A day of a non-selling manzaishi.

270
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,208
In the afternoon, the script for the gag is a mess after all.

271
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:01,397
I can't do special training.

272
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:05,422
A day of unsold manzai poems.

273
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:10,290
At night, as expected, I couldn't sleep at all.

274
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:19,352
Sayonara.

275
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,863
Kou-san?

276
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:22,565
Yes.

277
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,129
I'm frustrated.

278
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:25,052
I have an answer.

279
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:26,736
The answer is a sticker.

280
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,085
Huh?

281
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:32,099
Isn't it fun?

282
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,749
What's a sticker?

283
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:34,976
Oh, really?

284
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:35,338
You don't know?

285
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,424
I don't know!

286
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,088
I don't know!

287
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:46,545
Rocket Punch!

288
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:47,871
No!

289
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,144
1st year of elementary school.

290
00:13:55,748 --> 00:14:03,514
Cherry blossom, cherry blossom, cherry blossom, cherry blossom, cherry blossom, cherry blossom

291
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,657
A year of brainwashing.

292
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:09,199
Summer.

293
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,242
Study outside.

294
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:10,824
Outside.

295
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:11,385
Outside.

296
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:11,987
Outside.

297
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,635
Continue.

298
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:18,094
One Year as an Elder

299
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:25,683
Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, Hiei, Asoga, Mine, Shirai, Tsutomi, Iijima, Ai, Hosokawa, Fumi...

300
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:25,924
They're in!

301
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:32,277
A year as a high school student.

302
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:32,961
He won a lottery in winter.

303
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,908
Daikyo.

304
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,633
Daikyo.

305
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:35,439
Daikyo.

306
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:35,681
Daikyo.

307
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,534
Oh, Kamsa, please!

308
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,585
Alright, here we go!

309
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,929
Another spring.

310
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,491
No more.

311
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:45,032
No more.

312
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:45,755
No more.

313
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:46,256
No more.

314
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:47,299
No more.

315
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:49,245
No more.

316
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:54,797
My body is so hot.

317
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,805
Ah, Minami no Shima!

318
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:06,548
Minami no Shima.

319
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,914
Both are wrong.

320
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:12,152
Do you know what it means when you say that your body is hot?

321
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,377
Your body is hot.

322
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:17,393
Hotel!

323
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,733
Oh, that's good.

324
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,058
I know what it is.

325
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:24,339
What is it?

326
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:28,897
It's a game where you have to solve a puzzle.

327
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:29,138
A puzzle?

328
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:30,724
You have to solve the puzzle.

329
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:40,849
It was good that I got it right, right?

330
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:45,080
Anyway, I'm going home now.

331
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,755
I'll stop here for today.

332
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:52,131
It's not October, it's April, so let's be flexible and do our best.

333
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:52,332
Yes!

334
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,881
See you.

335
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:55,965
I'm going home.

336
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:57,370
Bye-bye.

337
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:07,748
In the spring, one of the foreign students said, I can't believe I'm eating such rotten food in the morning.

338
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:12,169
Japanese people don't understand at all.

339
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,944
One day, an international student was stuffed like a female cow in the morning.

340
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:24,825
I don't understand Japanese people at all.

341
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:28,633
One day, a foreign student.

342
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:29,577
It was noon.

343
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:33,094
This woman was a college student.

344
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:37,296
Japanese people don't understand at all.

345
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:49,277
One day, a foreign student said, I don't understand why there are so many Yankees.

346
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:54,492
One day, a foreign student

347
00:16:55,248 --> 00:17:02,777
People in Japan don't know that they're doing ecchi on TV at night.

348
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:17,779
Next week will be a special live broadcast.

349
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,522
Right?

350
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:23,061
I don't know what's going to happen.

351
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,436
Let's do our best so that no one will say that we have a serious injury.

352
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,442
Please cheer for the people who are watching the TV.

353
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:30,825
Yes!

354
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,536
Then, let's have a great day today!

355
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:33,220
Bye-bye!
