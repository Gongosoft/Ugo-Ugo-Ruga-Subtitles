1
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:15,031
He's watching a behind-the-scenes show at 7.30 in the morning!

2
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,639
Sakamoto, who hasn't played in a while, is getting beaten up by Maki-moku-moku!

3
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:32,181
Finally, the long-awaited show begins!

4
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:38,501
Udo and Toruga are waiting in another room.

5
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,533
Today, TV-kun will go to your house.

6
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:41,733
Let's go!

7
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:42,677
Let's go!

8
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:51,705
It's a word for everyone in front of the TV.

9
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:59,839
Even though he doesn't know much about it, if he starts talking to the police, he will fail a lot.

10
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,868
We'll do our best not to say OK on the live broadcast.

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,867
With that said, OKIRAKU GOKURAKU OKIRAKU GOKURAKU Yes, we did it.

12
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:25,553
Good morning!

13
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:30,923
Today is April 5th, Monday.

14
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:35,513
It's 7.31.33.

15
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,807
Everyone in front of the TV is at the same time, so this is a live broadcast.

16
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:42,489
I'm excited.

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,853
So, what are we going to do today?

18
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,060
7th round news.

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,642
News!

20
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,905
It's news.

21
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:52,739
I'm the caster, and I'll explain to Kuogoi-kun and Luga-chan.

22
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,547
Well, I don't know what it's going to be, but please explain.

23
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:55,948
Yes!

24
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,007
Before the news gets out,

25
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,727
The studio is also excited.

26
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:07,744
Before we move on to the news, let's have Shuru say a few words of apology.

27
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,890
Excusez moi.

28
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,820
Excusez moi.

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,202
That's right.

30
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:16,519
If you make a mistake, you have to say, excusez moi.

31
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,676
If you do that, you'll get hit, so be careful.

32
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:22,529
Alright, let's get started.

33
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,518
The price formation.

34
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:30,116
It started in Vancouver, Canada on the 4th day of the Japanese time.

35
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:34,474
At the beginning of the day, President Clinton of the United States and President Ericsson of Russia

36
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,517
The total cost is 1.6 billion dollars.

37
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:39,925
It's shown in the plan.

38
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:47,113
Today, on the 2nd, the issue of financial security has been discussed and the declaration of co-operation has been announced.

39
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,621
It's hard.

40
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:51,678
Did you understand the story?

41
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:52,865
I don't understand.

42
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:54,353
I don't understand what Silk is reading.

43
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:59,360
By the way, do you know Kurinton?

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,043
Yes, I do!

45
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,381
We've seen Kurikinton and many others before.

46
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:09,580
Clinton is the president of the United States.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,371
Clinton will give $1 billion to the Russian agent.

48
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:18,737
That's about 2,840 billion yen.

49
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,355
5th place.

50
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:26,119
What would you like to buy?

51
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,546
Let's move on to the next one.

52
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:32,595
De La Formation 2.

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,447
The semi-finalist wins.

54
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,916
The SEVA Low League Tournament is...

55
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,643
It's the 4th day.

56
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:38,345
I'm so excited.

57
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:38,988
The 4th day.

58
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,598
The winner's and the loser's rounds will be held.

59
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:45,332
The Parig Tournament will be held in Nippon Ham.

60
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:52,170
HANSHIN won 3-0 against KUKANPU in the middle of the race.

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,917
He won 20 million yen.

62
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:57,266
As expected.

63
00:03:57,346 --> 00:04:02,402
As expected, Osaka people are strong when it comes to money.

64
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,486
As expected.

65
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:04,750
But Kiryu-kun is a yakuza fan.

66
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,532
Please do your best.

67
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,059
Let's move on to the next one.

68
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,074
Let's see the weather information.

69
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:10,717
Here it is.

70
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:11,239
It's a Chinese woman.

71
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,108
It's a Japanese-style incident.

72
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,154
Oh, is it only 1 minute and 30 seconds left?

73
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,190
It's been a while since I've been here.

74
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,420
It's in the east of Oki in Togoshima prefecture.

75
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,564
On Tuesday night, Hokkaido's TAKEMASU FOOTBALL GAME will be played by 145 people from China.

76
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,989
I can't read any of them.

77
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,515
What should we do?

78
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:34,489
In other words, the Chinese have joined Japan.

79
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,631
It's Mikko.

80
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,564
He's making a lot of mistakes.

81
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:41,779
At times like this, you can say, excuse me.

82
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,997
In other words, it's a secret country.

83
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,327
Have you ever heard of a foreign country?

84
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,135
Well, I don't think so.

85
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,526
Well then, let's go home, Shulgu.

86
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:53,848
Yes!

87
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:58,047
We're going to the supermarket today, but we're going to do it tomorrow.

88
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,267
We're going home now.

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,135
Bye-bye!

90
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:12,643
Ugo-go weather forecast.

91
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:15,304
Good morning, I'm Tororin.

92
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:18,178
Let's take a look at the weather all over the country.

93
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,022
First, let's take a look at Okinawa.

94
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,982
Naga seems to have a bad eye from time to time.

95
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:28,777
Now, I will land in Kyushu.

96
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:28,877
Yes.

97
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,057
What about Kyushu?

98
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:34,666
Fukuoka is sunny and sunny.

99
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:35,569
It's cloudy in the morning.

100
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,532
Let's go to Shikoku this time.

101
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,057
Nangokuto is sunny and cloudy.

102
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,965
Ta-da!

103
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,833
Finally, we're in Osaka!

104
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:46,132
The southern sky is sometimes cloudy, and in the morning, it's a bit cloudy.

105
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:46,815
Ta-da-da-da!

106
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,441
Next is Nagoya.

107
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:53,359
Nagoya is sunny and cloudy.

108
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,607
Let's go to Tokyo.

109
00:05:55,587 --> 00:06:00,750
It's cloudy in Tokyo.

110
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:02,478
Let's keep going.

111
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,242
We're going up to Niigata.

112
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,467
Niigata is a place where it rains or snows when it's cloudy.

113
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:09,295
It's already spring, and it's snowing.

114
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,120
And Sendai is sometimes cloudy.

115
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,148
Let's keep drinking.

116
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,862
Let's go to Hokkaido and Sapporo.

117
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:19,864
Sometimes it's cold, and sometimes it's snowing.

118
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:21,291
It's cold all over the country.

119
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:28,058
That's all for Tororin's Ugo Ugo Tenkyouhou!

120
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,634
What did you do today?

121
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:32,317
I did math and math.

122
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:34,044
I did math and math.

123
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:34,285
How was it?

124
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,463
Oh, good morning.

125
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,712
My name is Hayashi.

126
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:39,853
Hello.

127
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:47,362
Today is April 1st, Tsurumaru's birthday.

128
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:48,628
Tomorrow is April 3rd.

129
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:55,543
Good morning.

130
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:57,893
My name is Harumi Hosono.

131
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:09,741
I'll talk about music today.

132
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,410
What do you think this is?

133
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:15,886
This is a baritone trio.

134
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:22,463
However, I can hear this in the music.

135
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:28,419
The locals don't make this as a musical instrument.

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,411
If you make a sound, it becomes a musical instrument.

137
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:36,870
Each of these sounds are just bamboo sounds, but the pitch changes a little.

138
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,401
When the sound is higher than one,

139
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:46,349
I was able to make my own music.

140
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,720
When I was a kid, I used to play with a can.

141
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,475
I used to hit the cardboard and play instead of the drum set.

142
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:59,892
So you don't need a high-end synthesizer to make music.

143
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:07,109
When I get home, I hit the can.

144
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,120
I do that many times.

145
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,907
I only listen to insects, but I listen to music.

146
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,922
Music is a familiar thing to me.

147
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:18,201
I'll remember that.

148
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,155
O-Yajibushi!

149
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:39,292
No, no, no, no!

150
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:40,864
As I thought, you have a good name!

151
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:56,283
He went to the mountains.

152
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,148
He spent 10 years thinking about his life.

153
00:08:57,128 --> 00:09:02,420
After a while, two people gathered in the city and crossed the mountain.

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,903
All the gods were dead.

155
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:07,751
Now we can only live with the power of humans.

156
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,079
After taking the teaching, he returned to the mountain again.

157
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:23,192
Haru no Ohanami!

158
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:29,852
If you put a cherry tree in the back of a flower, you'll be like Fujii Daisuke from Sapporo, and Aokiya-sensei from Setagaya, Tokyo.

159
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:48,097
It's time for Tomato's phone call.

160
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:48,378
Good morning!

161
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,727
This week, you can't just cry like that!

162
00:09:55,735 --> 00:10:02,944
Ugo Ugo-kun and Ryuga-chan, think hard and let's do our best to find the right answer together!

163
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:03,749
Let's go!

164
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,265
Let's make a tomato phone call!

165
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,956
Pop, pop, pop, pop!

166
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:11,366
Congratulations!

167
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:17,946
Today's consultation is from Nozomi Suzuki of Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, who is 9 years old.

168
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,781
First, Tomato will read a postcard.

169
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:26,128
My brother is kind, but he doesn't call my name when he calls me.

170
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,286
He calls me monkey, or husband, or Taro.

171
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:35,592
She wants you to call her properly, so she wants you to tell her what to do.

172
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:36,938
Nozomi-kun, are you there?

173
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,263
Yes, I am.

174
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,952
Nozomi-kun!

175
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:43,361
How are you?

176
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,949
Good morning!

177
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,595
Nozomi-kun, are you really born like that?

178
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:52,001
I'm in trouble.

179
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,367
Is that so?

180
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,351
Yes.

181
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,736
How old are you?

182
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:56,539
I'm in my second year of college.

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,346
Yes.

184
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,552
Is that so?

185
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:04,979
Yes.

186
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,607
What do you think, Ugo Ugo-kun?

187
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,014
About being called like that.

188
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,219
That's tough!

189
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,291
What about you, Ryuga?

190
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:11,372
No!

191
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,567
Yes.

192
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:20,586
Tomatoes used to be called the power of demijohn when they were very big.

193
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:21,649
But, Nozomi-kun,

194
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,738
Nozomi-kun!

195
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,517
You know, when people call you a monkey, you say, like, I'm so happy, thank you!

196
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:36,988
You know, if you keep doing it, you might not be able to say it because it's boring.

197
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:41,494
I like the way you talk, so I have to stop for a while.

198
00:11:57,353 --> 00:12:05,085
Nozomi, what do you think?

199
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:12,628
But I like it a lot.

200
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:19,476
Is that so?

201
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,440
Nozomi-kun, are you playing with the monkeys?

202
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:21,083
When I was in first grade,

203
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:29,453
My brother put a ball on the shelf and brought a towel and threw it around.

204
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:40,152
Yeah!

205
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:52,630
Well then, Ugo-go and Ryuga-chan, let's do our best tomorrow as well and get through the trouble!

206
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:53,595
Yes!

207
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:54,701
Well then, bye-bye!

208
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:55,626
Bye-bye!

209
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,109
Thank you.

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,244
What was that?

211
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:50,873
You're not going out?

212
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,731
Haha, I'm not going out until tomorrow.

213
00:13:52,964 --> 00:14:02,111
Then, since Ishizawa is doing a live broadcast today, Uogoruga will answer the riddles that everyone in front of the TV has come up with.

214
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:02,974
Is that okay?

215
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:08,762
Hi, that's right, that's right, that's right.

216
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:16,960
Let's start with the first question.

217
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,575
It's a question from Ishii Yasutomo from Matsudo, Chiba.

218
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:24,249
In Ichi-kun's letter, it says, please call me Tomo-kun.

219
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:25,494
Tomo-kun!

220
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:26,758
Tomo-kun!

221
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,883
Can you hear me?

222
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:27,983
Yes.

223
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:28,426
Yes.

224
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:29,836
Tomo-kun, is that okay?

225
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:31,346
Yes.

226
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,400
Then, Tomo-kun, please answer the question.

227
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:33,501
Yes.

228
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,824
What's a miracle when you play pro-wrestling?

229
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:40,206
Huh?

230
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,331
When you play pro-wrestling?

231
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,075
A strong tree?

232
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,365
It's a tree, right?

233
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:45,466
Yes.

234
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,098
Okay, then... Mr. Nuga, do you know what it is?

235
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,780
Is it difficult?

236
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:52,969
It's difficult.

237
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:53,612
It's difficult.

238
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:53,934
It's difficult.

239
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:55,119
It's difficult.

240
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:55,440
It's difficult.

241
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,063
It's difficult.

242
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,432
I don't know.

243
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,404
I don't have time.

244
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,075
I'll be there in 10 seconds.

245
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:04,951
I don't have time, but what should I do?

246
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,678
Before I say the hint, what's the answer?

247
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,386
Shall I say the answer?

248
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:09,129
Inoki.

249
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:10,896
Inoki?

250
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,495
This is so cute!

251
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:15,839
This is amazing!

252
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:16,363
It's like a rocket punch!

253
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:19,993
Thank you, Tomoku.

254
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,463
Okay, let's move on to the next person.

255
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,788
This person is from Minami-ku, Fukuoka.

256
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:27,141
It's Hayashida Mami-chan's question.

257
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,486
Mami-chan!

258
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:29,228
Can you hear me?

259
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:29,590
Mami-chan!

260
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:29,871
Good morning!

261
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,617
Please tell us the question.

262
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,745
Okay, I'll do the quiz.

263
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:38,571
Sokupan and Gansupan were walking

264
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:45,490
From the back, if you call it Ooi, which do you prefer, Sokupan or Francepan?

265
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,394
French bread!

266
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:49,241
French bread?

267
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:49,523
Why?

268
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,992
Grandpa!

269
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:58,516
What?

270
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:00,812
What's wrong?

271
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,222
I'll turn around.

272
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,532
It's my first time.

273
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:06,718
There's no more time.

274
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:09,148
What's your answer, Mami-chan?

275
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,742
The answer is bread.

276
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,034
Because bread has ears.

277
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:15,763
This is amazing!

278
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:19,932
Robot-kun?

279
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,941
Yes?

280
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,086
This is super difficult!

281
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,130
Super difficult?

282
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:28,268
Well, since we don't have much time, let's do our best tomorrow!

283
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:33,892
That's all for today!

284
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:34,073
Bye-bye!

285
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:42,679
I can't do it.

286
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,975
Ah!

287
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,192
Ah!

288
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:51,273
Ah!

289
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:51,353
Ah!

290
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:07,232
It's spring now.

291
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:10,061
When spring comes, I play Hakodate with my guitar Why?

292
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:17,222
Because I play Hakodate with my guitar This is a big hit

293
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:22,675
Let's take a short break.

294
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:23,601
This is Okutani from Naniwa's Nishinbanzaiji.

295
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,558
Hello, I'm Jackie.

296
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,215
It's your first time on the stage, but your title is too big.

297
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:36,550
Don't mess with me!

298
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:37,355
What?

299
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,469
What are you talking about?

300
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:40,999
It's you!

301
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,276
Look at that!

302
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,696
Good morning, everybody!

303
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:55,720
Good morning, kids!

304
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,391
Today we're doing a live broadcast.

305
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,970
For the first week of the show, Tony will introduce some great sounds.

306
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,366
UOGO Song Album Today's guest is my best friend, Yoko.

307
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:12,960
The song I'm going to sing today is Chichi Kaka.

308
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,133

312
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:12,665
Thank you, thank you, Yoko-chan.

00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,043
Okay, please give a round of applause.

314
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,765
How was it, Yoko?

315
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:23,312
I'm a big fan of this show, so I had a lot of fun today.

316
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,850
By the way, Yoko-chan, can I ask you a favor?

317
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:26,918
Yes.

318
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,247
Please give me your autograph.

319
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:28,932
Oh, I got it.

Let's try Tony's Go!

323
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,547

00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:36,070
No Okusama!

325
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,707
Let's do it together, Yoko-chan.

326
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:41,693
I'm sleepy.

327
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,132
And the last one is a big laugh.

328
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,346
Okay!

329
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,351
Thank you, Yoko-chan!

330
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:53,670

332
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:00,698
Bye-bye.

333
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:02,344
Men's Search for Treasures

334
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:07,843
Now, let's find the treasure.

335
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:11,798
Dig, dig, and dig.

336
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:12,079
The aquarium.

337
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:12,199
Alex.

338
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:23,134
Hello, can you introduce me to the Gorugoro Museum?

339
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:26,127
Good morning again.

340
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:29,164
Good morning!

341
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,431
You must be tired.

342
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:31,437
Let's take a deep breath.

343
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:40,435
Tony's voice doesn't change much, does it?

344
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,705
The content was a bit too much, so let's call it a day.

345
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,258
Churyu-kun's morning art.

346
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:50,927
First of all, the first work, please.

347
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:57,762
This is a work by Shigemitsu Ogiso of Tachikawa City, Tokyo.

348
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:00,279
What do you think?

349
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,768
It's amazing, isn't it?

350
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,600
This is truly the red of Matisse.

351
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:06,432
That's right.

352
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:06,936
Wonderful.

353
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,646
Next work, please.

354
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,409
Sapporo City's...

355
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,649
Hirama Taku-kun.

356
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:18,805
He looks angry.

357
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,273
It's not good.

358
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:24,551
Isn't this a work that can be considered to be a high-level impressionist work?

359
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:24,732
Yes!

360
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:24,873
Yes!

361
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:29,813
Then, shall we move on to the next one?

362
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:30,094
Here you go.

363
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:36,119
Yuki Takahashi of Sendai City, 9 years old.

364
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,485
She's wonderful.

365
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:40,472
This looks like Giacometti.

366
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:41,436
Let's go right away.

367
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:42,860
What is this?

368
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,426
What is this?

369
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:46,191
It's stuck.

370
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:47,897
Let's go next.

371
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:54,753
Otaku's biggest friend, Haseko.

372
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:55,558
Roboto-kun.

373
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,856
Not-kun's Rocket Punch.

374
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:01,296
As expected of him.

375
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:10,423
Children are all artists See you tomorrow!

376
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:11,286
Bye bye!

377
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:11,493
you

378
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,247
Yaaay!

379
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:26,743
It seems that you have to fail to do a live broadcast to have fun.

380
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,956
Good morning!

381
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,509
I'm P.R.

382
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,937
Taki from the Electric Group!

383
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:40,800
Big brother!

384
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:49,947
KABUTOMUSHI!

385
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:57,578
So everyone, how was the live broadcast of Uogoruga?

386
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:58,481
Was it interesting?

387
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:03,379
Hayashi Apei-san and Boncho Samu-san, please support us.

388
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,192
We have a great guest tomorrow as well.

389
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:09,808
TV-kun is going back to the studio now.

390
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,781
It was only 30 minutes, but how was it?

391
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:15,443
It was fun!

392
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:17,650
Was it fun?

393
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,492
Yes!

394
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:22,043
Lastly, I'll teach you one more word, okay?

395
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,377
Tomorrow will be a windy day!

396
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:24,658
Tomorrow!

397
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,072
Tomorrow will be a windy day!

398
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,525
That's right.

399
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:33,788
Tomorrow is tomorrow, so it's better not to be nervous.

400
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:39,472
It was a live broadcast that you don't know what will happen.

401
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,280
Let's do our best tomorrow.

402
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,671
Are you okay?

403
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,233
I'm okay!

404
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,198
Let's hurry up!

405
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:45,419
Okay!

406
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,112
Then, let's take off again today!

407
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,739
Bye-bye!

408
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:49,920
Bye-bye!

409
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:03,336
Now, it's the first day of the year.
