1
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,923
Good morning.

2
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,027
How are you?

3
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,419
Today is the second day of live broadcasting.

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,225
Fugogo and Luga are preparing in another room.

5
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:28,570
There are a lot of guests.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,794
Now, TV-kun will go to everyone's house.

7
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:33,598
Let's go!

8
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:42,722
Let me introduce you to the people in front of the TV.

9
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,545
Are you ready?

10
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:44,770
One or two?

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,750
I don't know if I can do it, but I'll leave it to God and try my best.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,224
It's a perfect word for a live broadcast.

13
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,852
Anyway, I had a great time today.

14
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:58,692
I was able to do a good job.

15
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:09,334
Good morning!

16
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:10,419
Good morning!

17
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,644
Good morning!

18
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:12,447
Good morning!

19
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:13,371
Good morning!

20
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:13,833
Good morning!

21
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:14,315
Good morning!

22
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,098
Good morning!

23
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:15,600
Good morning!

24
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:21,321
When it's over, let's go to the cart!

25
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,689
Oh, okay, that's good.

26
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,404
I saw you yesterday, and you were completely out of breath.

27
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:31,519
This is a correction.

28
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:37,057
$16 billion was spent on 1845 yen.

29
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:40,187
This is actually 1150 billion yen.

30
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,133
Yes, I'll miss this.

31
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:46,059
Today, I'm going to eat French food.

32
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:50,413
I'm going to eat French food.

33
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:56,494
It doesn't matter.

34
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:58,399
It doesn't matter.

35
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,285
It doesn't matter.

36
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,458
Let's check out the news.

37
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:19,152
It is said that the railroad that was opened in Vancouver, Canada, six days ago was 16 billion dollars from the United States

38
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:28,568
Listen to what people are saying.

39
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,165
Let's go!

40
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:35,588
Let's go!

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,361
Who is the winner of the Yudomiya Koukei?

42
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,227
Who is the winner of the Yudomiya Koukei?

43
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,150
Who is the winner of the Koukei?

44
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,510
It's amazing, isn't it?

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,271
It's the first time in a long time.

46
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,275
I've heard it all.

47
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:11,734
Uenomiya high school in Osaka beat Kigan by 3-0.

48
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,725
The Osaka team is really strong.

49
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:22,332
They have Hanshin, but the other staff members are also in trouble.

50
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,485
Let's go to the next one.

51
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,786
Let's go to the next one.

52
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:34,971
This one is different.

53
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:49,433
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:55,019
Let's go to the next place.

55
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:55,682
Yes.

56
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,088
Did you watch the movie?

57
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:57,269
No.

58
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:57,972
It was yesterday's video.

59
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:06,122
In the case of the large-scale fire accident that occurred yesterday, the mayor of Oshima Prefecture did not read the report at all.

60
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:10,129
Shuro-kun, you're not good at this.

61
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,259
Shuro-kun, you're not good at this.

62
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,625
Let's move on.

63
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:14,509
Okay!

64
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:21,094
It's a vegetable.

65
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,626
It's a vegetable.

66
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:36,126
In addition to the fact that Kichigin has entered the market, it is also said that it will be the highest in the market with 109 times and 83 times in the end.

67
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:42,869
In other words, the value of the yen is probably higher.

68
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,960
It's easier to calculate if it's 1 dollar 100 yen.

69
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,529
Shuri, I think you know the problem at all.

70
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,232
I only know this one.

71
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:53,067
You know the answer to the question.

72
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:53,490
Did you understand?

73
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,233
It's no good!

74
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,720
It's interesting!

75
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:00,851
Let's go back.

76
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:03,282
See you later!

77
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:03,463
Bye-bye!

78
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,685
You can do it!

79
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,726
Good morning.

80
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,050
I'm Tororin.

81
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,501
I'm so excited today that I'm going to study abroad.

82
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:27,082
I'm from Okinawa.

83
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,346
I was born in Japan.

84
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,991
I'm going to study abroad in the afternoon.

85
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:33,310
Let's go to Kyushu!

86
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,644
Let's go to Fukuoka!

87
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,639
I'm in Shikoku now.

88
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,919
I'm still in Shikoku.

89
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,487
I'll go to Shikoku.

90
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:49,389
It's sunny here in Nankokuto-san's house!

91
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,072
And Hiroshima is...

92
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:54,547
I'm sorry I skipped the flight yesterday.

93
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,494
Let's go to Osaka.

94
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,982
The sky is so clear today.

95
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:03,530
Let's go step by step.

96
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,636
Nagoya is full of sunshine.

97
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,260
It feels like I'm in Okinawa.

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,986
It's live!

99
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:07,568
Live!

100
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:08,030
Live!

101
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:08,391
Live!

102
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:10,238
Live!

103
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,463
Live!

104
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,045
Live!

105
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:14,052
Live!

106
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,216
Live!

107
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:19,248
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

108
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:20,111
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

109
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,134
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

110
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:21,916
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

111
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:22,879
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

112
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,581
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

113
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,504
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

114
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:25,206
It's a sunny day in the afternoon.

115
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:25,733
Come on then!

116
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:27,231
Bye-bye!

117
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,842
Let's go to Sapporo!

118
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,552
Sapporo will be covered with snow and rain.

119
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:34,417
It's going to be a hot day.

120
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,006
My friends are coming to the studio today, so I'm very hungry.

121
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:39,921
That's all for today's video!

122
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:51,970
How is it?

123
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,357
Hello, I'm Fairchild's Yui.

124
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:57,707
I've brought you some coffee.

125
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm a musician, but I've grown a beard.

126
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,510
Tell us!

127
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:08,811
Great job!

128
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:15,838
Good morning.

129
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,945
Itoi Shigesato!

130
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:27,188
Today, we're going to talk about the topic of the useful titan battle.

131
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,875
To enjoy more titan baseball, first of all,

132
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:32,293
It's very quiet.

133
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,504
You can hear a variety of sounds.

134
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,389
If you can't hear them,

135
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:40,087
You lose about 70% of the fun of baseball.

136
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:41,271
70% is a lie.

137
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,375
You lose a little.

138
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:49,526
If you try to keep that layer quiet, you'll realize how much more interesting it was.

139
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,197
Please keep that in mind for this year's Kyojin Club.

140
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,867
The next thing is to give a useful applause to the fans.

141
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:04,583
It may seem like an ordinary game, but it's a good one.

142
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,556
You can't tell if that's a good play or not.

143
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,352
At times like that, you can't help but give them a round of applause.

144
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:12,818
And the players can play like this.

145
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:18,471
Then the customer will understand, and it will be even better.

146
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:24,419
If you play well, we'll give you a round of applause!

147
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,071
This year, Kojima played quietly and with a lot of momentum.

148
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:27,533
This is his team's...

149
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:33,473
And by becoming a good titan, you can become a good person.

150
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:36,588
That was my goal in 1993.

151
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:40,968
I will do my best to support them.

152
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,957
I will do my best.

153
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,846
Go, Go, Luger!

154
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:02,168
Oh, no!

155
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,055
He's pushing it for two minutes!

156
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,886
What are you talking about?

157
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:12,710
How many years have passed since then?

158
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,433
My thoughts are still in the world.

159
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:18,395
Zoroastra went back to the mountains and went to the most happy island.

160
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:22,815
Zoroastra is the only one who loves people in front of people.

161
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:32,215
He is going to teach us how to do it He is going to teach us how to do it He is going to teach us how to do it He is going to teach us how to do it

162
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:35,707
Let's continue!

163
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:36,332
Baloo's Magic Trigger!

164
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:41,579
It's the opening of the baseball penance!

165
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:47,858
When dynamite is put on the pitcher mount at the baseball field, 5-year-old Kiyota Niseki from Fusa City, Tokyo, and 12-year-old Naomi Mizukami from Karasu City, Saga Prefecture,

166
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,208
Biro Biro Art!

167
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,944
Tomato-chan's phone call.

168
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:08,209
It was cold yesterday, but it was cold this morning, too.

169
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,195
Did you two catch a cold?

170
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,057
No, we didn't.

171
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,442
That's right.

172
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,588
Please take care of your health.

173
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:19,589
We've got a lot of letters from friends who are struggling to keep their spirits up.

174
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,401
We'll read them to you.

175
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,788
Let's make it warm!

176
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:28,960
Today, I'm going to talk to Masaru Watanabe from Shimotsuga, Tochigi Prefecture.

177
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,561
Tomato!

178
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,868
I don't have a postcard, but I'll read it!

179
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm a 5-year-old crybaby, and I cry once a day.

180
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,782
How can I cure this crybaby?

181
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:40,144
Masaru!

182
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:40,486
Yes?

183
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,042
Can you hear me?

184
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:46,101
Yes, I can hear you.

185
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:46,262
Masaru!

186
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:49,503
Masaru, why are you crying so much?

187
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,376
That's right.

188
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:52,617
Is that so?

189
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:53,822
Did you cry when you woke up today?

190
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,535
I didn't cry, but yesterday... Did you cry yesterday?

191
00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,499
Yes, I did.

192
00:10:59,519 --> 00:10:59,599
Why?

193
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,686
I had a fight with my sister and she scolded me.

194
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,272
Are you such a crybaby?

195
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:04,413
Yes.

196
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:06,683
Do you always cry for little things?

197
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,415
Yes, I cry a lot for little things.

198
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,757
Gogo, what do you think?

199
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,207
Is Gogo such a crybaby?

200
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,654
What?

201
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,644
Does it cry when it moves?

202
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,554
Sometimes it cries.

203
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:21,022
What about you, Luka?

204
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:21,987
Sometimes it cries.

205
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,681
Oh, really?

206
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:27,097
I'm scared when my mom gets angry.

207
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:27,943
And when my sister gets angry.

208
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:31,804
Yes, tomato tears are the sweat of the heart.

209
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,660
I think it's okay to cry when you want to, but...

210
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,747
But Masaru-kun, if you cry even a little bit, even if you cry when you have to, it won't work.

211
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:45,462
I can't believe you cried in front of Mr.

212
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:46,666
Potato.

213
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,120
Do you understand?

214
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,742
Yes, I do.

215
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,010
Masaru-kun, do your best!

216
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,312
Yes!

217
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,600
Are you okay?

218
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,862
I'm okay.

219
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,753
Are you going to cry again today?

220
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,323
I'm going to cry.

221
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:01,741
See you later, Ryo-chan.

222
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,478
You three.

223
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:11,738
I want to give you strength, but what do you want me to say?

224
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:12,240
Don't cry.

225
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,540
Don't cry?

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,523
Shall we go together?

227
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:16,257
Ready, set, go!

228
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,582
Yes, I understand.

229
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:20,608
Are you okay, Masaru?

230
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,211
Yes, I'm okay.

231
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:24,913
Tomato, you're a great crybaby, aren't you?

232
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:29,334
Somehow, I feel like I'm friends with Masaru-kun.

233
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:29,716
What?

234
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:31,946
Haven't you two forgotten?

235
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:33,132
What?

236
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:37,348
I haven't forgotten!

237
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,637
Masaru-kun, you really need to do your best!

238
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:41,504
Yes, I'll do my best!

239
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:42,447
Three, two, one, go!

240
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:46,385
Masaru-kun, bye-bye!

241
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,741
Bye-bye!

242
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:52,496
Uga Uga and Luka-chan, let's talk about your worries tomorrow as well!

243
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:52,898
Yes!

244
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,564
Yes!

245
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:55,749
Well then, bye-bye!

246
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:56,773
Bye-bye!

247
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,246
Oh, my goodness.

248
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:57,051
Today, let's do our best not to lose to everyone in front of the TV!

249
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:09,992
The first question is from Ryo Iwakiri from Hiratsuka, Kanagawa prefecture.

250
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,979
Good morning, Ryo.

251
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:12,340
Good morning.

252
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,703
Yes.

253
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:20,698
Then, please say the question.

254
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:21,621
Where are the frogs, Mr. Frog?

255
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:25,937
Wani plus Waniwa.

256
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,730
Wani plus Waniwa.

257
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,100
Niwa.

258
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,703
Niwa.

259
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:32,607
That's correct.

260
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,717
Peep-a!

261
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,527
What did you say?

262
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:40,372
Washi!

263
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:41,097
Washi!

264
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,492
Washi is correct, right?

265
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:43,835
I did it!

266
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:44,217
It's rocket punch!

267
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,729
Ryo-kun!

268
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,888
What's wrong, Ryo-kun?

269
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:51,270
You know...

270
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:56,495
The words overlap and form a big circle, right?

271
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,527
A big circle, yes.

272
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,563
So, 2 plus 2 is 4, right?

273
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:05,091
So, you read it as 4, and it becomes 4.

274
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:15,549
Thank you!

275
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:19,664
Here's the second question!

276
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:20,768
Next is from Senju, Agachiku

277
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,520
It's Nakanishi Chiharu-chan's problem!

278
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,337
Good morning, Chiharu-chan!

279
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:27,437
Huh?

280
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:28,783
Good morning, Chiharu-chan!

281
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:36,135
It seems that there is no improvement, so I will go next.

282
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:39,550
Is Saki Nobuyama of Nerinax Toyotama here?

283
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,304
What do you think?

284
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:46,053
I don't think this is going to work.

285
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:46,455
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:49,825
I was going to ask you a question, but that's it for today.

287
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:50,046
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:53,623
Well, see you tomorrow!

289
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:57,539
BUDDY!

290
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,404
BUDDY!

291
00:15:59,108 --> 00:15:59,611
BUDDY!

292
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:01,400
BUDDY!

293
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:02,245
BUDDY!

294
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:02,888
BUDDY!

295
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:09,533
Koyachibushi!

296
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,553
What are you doing?

297
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:13,097
It's a firework!

298
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:19,307
THE END

299
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:27,745
There are a lot of jokes, but the one that suits the morning is... Well, good night!

300
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:32,626
It's not funny, but let's make it even more funny.

301
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,951
Let's make it even more funny.

302
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:35,497
Let's make it even more funny.

303
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,207
Let's make it even more funny.

304
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:47,982
Chiyoko-chan, you're getting up early today.

305
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:48,785
I can't do this anymore.

306
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:49,328
I want to go home.

307
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,172
Let's go home.

308
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,438
I'm so tired.

309
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,006
Let's go home.

310
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,011
We haven't done anything yet.

311
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,619
30 seconds is enough.

312
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,850
Let's go home.

313
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,281
Don't fool around with Non-tan!

314
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:01,803
Non-tan?

315
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,569
Non-tan means...

316
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,572
Mom, I'm sorry!

317
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:07,401
That's Tantan!

318
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,273
They're looking for treasure.

319
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,390
Boris is looking for rats.

320
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,495
They're rampaging.

321
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:38,248
Hello, can you introduce me to Musée Ngorongoro?

322
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:44,357
Bonjour, les enfants.

323
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,830
Bonjour, Papa.

324
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,137
Comment ça va?

325
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,394
How are you, Saba?

326
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,892
I'm fine, thank you!

327
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,862
Let's go see Shiro's morning art!

328
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:03,913
ICHIKAWA City, Shigehara, Kazami-chan, 8 years old.

329
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,299
He's a grumpy boy.

330
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,814
It's a masterpiece that expressed the pain of the heart.

331
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,724
The next one.

332
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:21,263
Yokohama, Yokohama, Yokohama, Yokohama, Yokohama, Yokohama,

333
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:23,309
It's time for the next one.

334
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:29,628
8-year-old Masamichi Kondo from Kitashushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture.

335
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:30,551
Shuri's son.

336
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,253
He's fat.

337
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,122
The color of his face is also different.

338
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:35,927
What do you think?

339
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,375
He looks just like me!

340
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:38,916
Just like Ugo-kun!

341
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:39,578
As expected.

342
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,180
Shall we move on?

343
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,569
Tomoyo Wada from Saitama Prefecture.

344
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,565
It's a little dangerous, but Shuri looks different.

345
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:49,512
Shall we move on?

346
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,815
He's Kato from Yokohama City.

347
00:18:54,993 --> 00:19:01,712
Let's move on.

348
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,621
Tenjiko Shinoguchi from Nagano Prefecture.

349
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,994
The Mikan Seijin was amazing today.

350
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:12,580
It was fun!

351
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,186
That's right.

352
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:18,943
But it was a refreshing morning.

353
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,067
I'm going home.

354
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:20,950
Bye-bye!

355
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:37,183
Well, today's live broadcast seems to have made a lot of mistakes.

356
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,297
Let's go for a drink!

357
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:47,996
Good morning!

358
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm Hano Aki!

359
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,949
I have a very happy announcement for you today!

360
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:57,990
The ending theme is Ugo Guruga-chan and me, Hanaaki!

361
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:02,654
How was the live broadcast of Go!

362
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:03,176
Go!

363
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:03,758
Luger today?

364
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,297
Well, I think it went well, but did you notice that Gachapin and Mook were there?

365
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,524
Well then, TV-kun will return to the studio tomorrow.

366
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,739
Bye-bye!

367
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,989
I don't know if it went well or not, but how was it?

368
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,476
It was amazing!

369
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,661
It was fun.

370
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,638
I think it was easy for the second day.

371
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,968
One last word, please.

372
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,623
Noruka-soruka.

373
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:34,065
Noruka-soruka.

374
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,837
The meaning is the same as the first word, Uchikabashi.

375
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:41,091
I'm not sure about the results, but we'll leave it to fate.

376
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:42,220
Let's do our best tomorrow!

377
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,426
Are you okay?

378
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,894
Let's hurry.

379
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,542
Anyway, see you later.

380
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:48,552
Bye-bye.

381
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:48,733
Bye-bye.

382
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,128
Buta-kun's Yonaoshi Dokkan-tai!

383
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,412
I'm so excited!

384
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:01,513
Eh?

385
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:03,238
How many seconds left?

386
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:03,359
Eh?

387
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,503
I have to wrap it up?

388
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:05,326
Eh?

389
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,409
Good bye!

390
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:07,212
Ah!
