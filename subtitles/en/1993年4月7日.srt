1
00:00:00,925 --> 00:00:05,037
Okonomiyengei Theater.

2
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:10,935
Hideto Sanshotei and Yuka Shuncho perform live from the Fuji Theater.

3
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:22,541
Good morning.

4
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:26,140
Yesterday's live broadcast was a little reflective.

5
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,498
Let's do our best today on the third day.

6
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:32,839
Now, I'm going to go to your house.

7
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,752
Excuse me.

8
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,329
I'd like to say a few words to everyone watching the TV.

9
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:42,593
You may begin.

10
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:48,651
You can relax and be in a good mood.

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,597
This is a very important word, isn't it?

12
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:52,583
I hope you have a good time.

13
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,869
Okira-kun!

14
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:55,698
Kokura-kun!

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,143
Good job!

16
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,657
Good morning!

17
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:06,437
Good morning!

18
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,701
Today is the 3rd day.

19
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,468
I'm very tired.

20
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,351
I'm very tired.

21
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,502
Let's go right away.

22
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:17,389
Today's first entry.

23
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:23,063
Shure-kun will get angry.

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,291
If you suddenly like it, you can't throw it.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,109
Don't get too excited.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,201
Shuri, who was left to be an unfamiliar newscaster, made a lot of wrong comments yesterday.

27
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,451
The audience got angry with the person in charge.

28
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:40,966
Everyone, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

29
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:42,972
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

30
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:46,698
That's where the ceremony began.

31
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:48,793
Today's ceremony.

32
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:56,436
The total of 16 billion dollars is 5 yen, which is 11.5 billion yen.

33
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:58,783
It's a big difference.

34
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:06,834
$1.6 billion in Japanese yen and 1.8 billion yen in Japanese yen.

35
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:07,778
That's a lot.

36
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:11,372
Be careful not to fall down.

37
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:18,983
It's a great title.

38
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:26,408
Foreign Minister Fukusori Watanabe, who is a close friend of Michi, has been appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday.

39
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh, that was close.

40
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,803
So, who's going to be the first one to come out?

41
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:39,975
Let's go next.

42
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:40,296
Let's go next.

43
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,078
The next one is...

44
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,226
Yes, no, Clinton.

45
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,755
Yes, no, Piro.

46
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:57,036
Today is the 3rd day of President Clinton's presidency

47
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:06,705
Japanese people say NO when they say YES.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,282
The U.S. Secretary of State admitted that there was such a statement.

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,766
Do you say hi and yeo properly?

50
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:22,502
You don't have to say hi no matter what you say.

51
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:22,703
Got it?

52
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,346
You don't understand at all, do you?

53
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:26,871
Shall we start?

54
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:30,097
What's going on here?

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,093
That's the one from yesterday.

56
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,701
If you come with Flinton, this is the one.

57
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:41,983
The Russian government and President Erichin seem to have made a big move.

58
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,427
It's not El, it's Erichin.

59
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:44,691
Let's move on.

60
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,408
What?

61
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:47,830
What?

62
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,434
What?

63
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:48,736
What?

64
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:48,957
What?

65
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:50,386
What?

66
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:50,829
What?

67
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:50,949
What?

68
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,070
What?

69
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:57,170
There is a rumor that a Chinese woman died in Gawashima.

70
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,385
Yesterday, an accident occurred in China.

71
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:08,615
The Chinese plane was taken by two Chinese people with weapons and landed at Taipei International Airport, Taiwan.

72
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,341
The culprit was caught and there was no witness.

73
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,571
That was good, wasn't it?

74
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:13,877
That was good, wasn't it?

75
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:15,746
Shall we move on to the last news?

76
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,288
Yes, please.

77
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,293
The last news is...

78
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,621
This is the next news.

79
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,564
This is a scoop.

80
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,030
Oh, it's gotten bigger.

81
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:23,996
The face is hidden.

82
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,883
It's a round of applause for Mikan Seijin's promotion.

83
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:33,949
Yesterday, the Mikan Seijin showed off the existence of the Mikan in a big way, and it was officially praised from Ichien-ren.

84
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:43,939
The reason for this is that all the elementary school students are staring at the orange-faced man in the middle of the school lunch.

85
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,334
It's a very soothing news.

86
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,951
So, today...

87
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,920
How did you like the show today?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,026
It was great!

89
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,978
Did you have any complaints about the show?

90
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:58,941
It was fun!

91
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,829
Well, let's wrap up here.

92
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:03,841
Please look forward to the next episode.

93
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,829
See you next time!

94
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,395
Bye-bye!

95
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,778
Yeah!

96
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:20,747
Igaru weather forecast!

97
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,368
Good luck!

98
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,715
I'm Toro Toro Tororin!

99
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,484
Well then, I'd like to go to the weather forecast again today!

100
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:27,025
First, from Okinawa!

101
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:29,232
It's cloudy inside, thump thump!

102
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:32,086
It's raining.

103
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:32,829
Let's go to Kyushu.

104
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:36,989
The effect is that it will be cloudy soon.

105
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,496
It's going to rain from the evening.

106
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:43,600
Next, we're in Shikoku!

107
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:44,906
Where are we going?

108
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,252
We're going to Hiroshima!

109
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:46,714
Where is Hiroshima?

110
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,366
It's sunny and cloudy.

111
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,295
It's Osaka.

112
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:54,510
It's sunny and cloudy in the sky of Osaka garden.

113
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,071
Let's go step by step.

114
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,381
The sky in Nagoya is getting darker and darker.

115
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:01,783
And Nagano is

116
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:06,492
Ah, I got it now.

117
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:15,616
The weather in Tokyo, where Dogo-kun and Ruga-chan live, is sunny and windy.

118
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:16,701
The weather in Niigata is cloudy and rainy from noon.

119
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:21,609
Yeah, I'm going to have a chicken dinner.

120
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:22,474
I'm going to have a chicken dinner.

121
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,198
I'm going to have a chicken dinner.

122
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:27,213
Finally, let's go to Hokkaido.

123
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,083
The weather in Sapporo is cloudy and sunny.

124
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,357
Ah, I want to eat Genghis Khan!

125
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:38,520
That's all for today's video!

126
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:39,263
Bye bye!

127
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:52,011
What are you looking at?

128
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:53,957
What are you looking at?

129
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,523
What are you looking at?

130
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:58,011
What are you looking at?

131
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,538
Do you know that song?

132
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,863
It's called KODOMO NANDA YO.

133
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,650
It's going to be released in May.

134
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,444
KODOMO NANDA YO.

135
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,633
I'm Haruo Shikata.

136
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:15,999
Nice to meet you!

137
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:16,200
Teach me!

138
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,063
You're a great person!

139
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:21,652
Good morning, everyone.

140
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,018
Did you wake up?

141
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,450
Today, F1 driver Katayama Ukyo will drive us from Brazil.

142
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:36,558
Have you ever thought about who you want to be in the future?

143
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,804
For example, a singer or a stewardess.

144
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,110
When I was little, I wanted to be a waitress.

145
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:47,961
I came to France to become a racing driver when I was 22 or 23 years old.

146
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:50,578
I made a lot of mistakes.

147
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,524
I made a lot of mistakes.

148
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,973
I made a lot of mistakes.

149
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:57,985
So now you've finally become a famous F1 driver, but the most important thing is...

150
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:06,270
First of all, to act with courage I want to work with amazing people in the world To think that you will be the best in the world

151
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,515
Don't be afraid.

152
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,965
Failure comes with a price.

153
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,274
Bigger failure than small success.

154
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,442
If you have something you want to do, do it as hard as you can.

155
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:23,426
Let's jump out into the world.

156
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:26,858
Jump out!

157
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:43,838
Mr. Musashi!

158
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:46,057
Mr. Musashi!

159
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:46,440
Matsuyo!

160
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,428
I'm Matsusho!

161
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:57,158
It's the third time for Sorakushitora to win!

162
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:00,287
After a really happy island, Sorakushitora came back to the mountains.

163
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:07,071
Anastra has been thinking about the new idea that there is no end to human life and that it will continue forever.

164
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:14,744
On a quiet night when the wind was blowing, a lightning struck in Zoroastra's heart.

165
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,993
Suddenly, he stood up and said, I love you!

166
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:28,883
At the entrance ceremony, they are showing their butt!

167
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:33,700
Takamatsu in Kagawa Prefecture, 8-year-old Masako Furuichi, 12-year-old Akiko Uemura from Otaku, Tokyo, and Hiyaki Maruyama from Yokohama Prefecture in Kanagawa Prefecture!

168
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:48,448
This is Tomato-chan's phone call.

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,994
It's cold in the morning, isn't it?

170
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:55,356
It's hot!

171
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,853
Even though it's April, you're still wearing Kate's underwear!

172
00:09:58,873 --> 00:09:59,215
Then...

173
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,218
Let's get started!

174
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:00,780
Okay!

175
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,378
The first question is from Yukari Nagashima from Kisarazu, Chiba.

176
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,682
Let's read it!

177
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:14,807
I'm scared to go to the bathroom at night, but what should I do to have fun?

178
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,232
Yukari-chan!

179
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:17,136
Yes!

180
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:20,172
Are you really scared?

181
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:20,332
Yes.

182
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,700
Did you see something scary?

183
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:26,333
I remember seeing something like a ghost.

184
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,935
It's scary, isn't it?

185
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,508
I've gotten scared since then!

186
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:32,072
I know!

187
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:33,302
I know what's scary!

188
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:37,979
Hey, Ugo-go and Luga-chan, are you scared to go to the bathroom at night?

189
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,382
I'm scared!

190
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:41,843
What are you going to do?

191
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:43,613
I'm scared of cockroaches.

192
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,563
Actually, tomatoes are scary, too.

193
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:51,763
That's why tomatoes sing songs only when they go to the bathroom.

194
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:56,201
I always sing, but Yukari-chan, I'll teach you a special one!

195
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:56,927
Okay.

196
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:06,196
U-la-la, u-la-la, u-la-ula de kono yo wa watashi no tame ni aru A-oh!

197
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,339
Yukari-chan, say A-oh too!

198
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,911
That's right!

199
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:10,895
This blue one is the key!

200
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:14,532
The ghost will run away with this blue one!

201
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:14,713
Right?

202
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,098
Yukari-chan, do your best!

203
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:16,781
Yes!

204
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,765
See you!

205
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,150
Bye bye!

206
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,094
Do your best!

207
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:20,636
Do your best!

208
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:21,519
Do your best!

209
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:21,920
Do your best!

210
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:22,322
Do your best!

211
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:23,045
Do your best!

212
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:23,386
Do your best!

213
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:23,888
Do your best!

214
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:24,450
Do your best!

215
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,715
I have someone I like, but I'm the only one who likes him.

216
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:34,432
What can I do to be in a relationship with the person I love?

217
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:35,556
Tell me, Takae-chan!

218
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:37,242
Are you such a wonderful person?

219
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:41,246
In some parts, I say I like you, but...

220
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:46,523
I say it, but...

221
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:50,173
I don't think I'm that scabby.

222
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:51,983
Scabby?

223
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:52,446
Scabby?

224
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:57,647
Luga-chan, I'd like to ask Luga-sensei, a professional lover, how about this?

225
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,354
Tell me!

226
00:11:59,374 --> 00:11:59,876
Luga-sensei!

227
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:00,900
What?

228
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,364
Aishuu?

229
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,234
I want to know how to do it!

230
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,422
Takae-chan!

231
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:12,578
I'll tell you how to do it!

232
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,588
You can do it, Takai-chan!

233
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,010
Attack!

234
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,533
You can do it!

235
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:15,935
Attack!

236
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:16,397
Attack!

237
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:16,598
Attack!

238
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:17,041
Attack!

239
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:17,322
Attack!

240
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:17,503
Attack!

241
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:17,724
Attack!

242
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:17,885
Attack!

243
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:18,046
Attack!

244
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:18,629
Attack!

245
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:18,890
Attack!

246
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,051
Attack!

247
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,352
Attack!

248
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:19,935
Attack!

249
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,101
I like you.

250
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,605
Let's say it together.

251
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:29,519
Good luck, Sakai-chan!

252
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:30,805
Bye-bye!

253
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:33,840
See you tomorrow!

254
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,913
Let's be helpful to others!

255
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,764
Bye bye!

256
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,219
Bye bye!

257
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:16,365
Oh, my God!

258
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,613
I made a mistake.

259
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,303
I made a mistake.

260
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,808
I made a mistake.

261
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:39,169
I made a mistake.

262
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,571
I made a mistake.

263
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:40,012
I made a mistake.

264
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:40,674
I made a mistake.

265
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:42,701
I made a mistake.

266
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,163
I made a mistake.

267
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:53,071
The first question is from Saki Nobuyama from Nerimac Toyotama.

268
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,597
Good morning, Saki.

269
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:55,279
Good morning.

270
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,647
I'm going to ask you a difficult question.

271
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,297
Here you go.

272
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,140
What's the question?

273
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:03,227
I'm going to ask you a difficult question.

274
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:10,365
If you go to the right, it gets higher, and if you go to the left, it gets lower.

275
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,421
It's hard.

276
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,993
Do you know, Luga-chan?

277
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:14,335
I don't know.

278
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:18,094
If you go to the right, it gets higher, and if you go to the left, it gets lower.

279
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:22,532
Ugo Ugo-kun, do you know?

280
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:23,658
I don't know.

281
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:24,503
You don't know?

282
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,588
Saki-chan, do you have a hint?

283
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:27,257
An answer?

284
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:28,631
A hint.

285
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:29,745
A hint.

286
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:30,818
The hint is...

287
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,437
Something that makes sound.

288
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,246
Something that makes sound.

289
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,257
What is something that makes sound, Ruga-chan?

290
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,664
Something like a sound museum.

291
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:39,508
What could it be?

292
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:46,902
Ruga-chan!

293
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:47,686
Rappa!

294
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:48,188
What?

295
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:48,570
Rappa!

296
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,508
It doesn't seem like it.

297
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:52,833
Saki-san, please give us the answer.

298
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:56,346
The answer?

299
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:56,788
The answer is...

300
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,954
The answer was the piano.

301
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,242
Oh, I see.

302
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:03,690
That's a great rocket punch.

303
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,684
Yay!

304
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,432
Thank you very much!

305
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,798
Here's the next question.

306
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:14,305
The next question is from Shiharu Nakanishi of Adachi Prefecture.

307
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:17,519
Good morning!

308
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,095
Good morning!

309
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:21,677
Good morning!

310
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,063
Good morning!

311
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:26,305
The bread is Portuguese.

312
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:27,876
The skin is Japanese.

313
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,104
What about the dessert?

314
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,279
What does dessert mean?

315
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,985
Say, Luka-chan.

316
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:32,952
Saladago.

317
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,128
What the heck is that?

318
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:38,219
Do you know Ugo-go-go?

319
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,152
It's foreign language.

320
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,319
Foreign language?

321
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,165
Maybe you're wrong.

322
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:46,784
This is a little difficult.

323
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,038
Jiharu, what is the answer?

324
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,164
The answer is food.

325
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:54,079
Oh, that's so funny!

326
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:04,808
That's it for today, but let's do our best tomorrow!

327
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:05,089
Yes!

328
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,395
Lastly, let's do a rocket punch!

329
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,524
Ready, rocket!

330
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:25,996
Hey, old man!

331
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:27,729
Go, go, Luger!

332
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,483
We've been connected since last night.

333
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:35,828
THE END

334
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:45,143
Speaking of funny jokes, there's this one.

335
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,193
You don't like it at all?

336
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,222
Let's have you laugh today as well!

337
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,237
Naniwa's beauty manzai, Sen'nichi-mae Chinatsu-an's Chiaki!

338
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,563
Let's have you laugh!

339
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,431
Hi, I'm Chiaki!

340
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,516
Which way are you looking at me?

341
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:02,019
Oh, that's right.

342
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,532
You had a bad dream last night, didn't you?

343
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:05,737
That's right.

344
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,469
President Elchin proposed to me yesterday.

345
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,896
I love you.

346
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,668
I need you.

347
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:13,813
I want you.

348
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:17,912
Don't fool around with Non-tan!

349
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:18,776
Non-tan?

350
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:19,660
I put Non-tan in my mouth.

351
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,624
Hey, it's Jin-tan!

352
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:23,196
I can't do it with you!

353
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:33,714
Hey, hey, hey!

354
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,340
Good morning, everybody!

355
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,396
Senor, senorita, buongiorno, Mr. Torino Utado Aramu.

356
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:49,386
Today's guest is the vocalist of ORIGINAL LOVE, TAKAO TAJIMA.

357
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,180
Mwah!

358
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,114
Ima wa hama, ima wa tekkyo ataru zo to

359
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:09,045
I'm flying through the tunnel without thinking I'm flying through the tunnel without thinking

360
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:18,394
IZ ALBUM will be released on June 6th!

361
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:37,328
Moriya

362
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:44,128
Shia, Haya, Hatake, Nohame, Ato, Eto, Tondeiku

363
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:47,371
OKAY!

364
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,396
OKAY!

365
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:49,460
BRAVO!

366
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:50,605
BRAVO!

367
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:51,831
OKAY!

368
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:54,422
Mr. Hajima, you were a little too high.

369
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,911
You were able to have a good feeling.

370
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:57,118
It's good, isn't it?

371
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,049
I can't help but feel the sound.

372
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,598
It's a good feeling.

373
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,867
Tajima-kun, how is it?

374
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:03,470
Me?

375
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,530
Tajima-kun, how is Tajima-san's song?

376
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,193
He's so cool.

377
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:13,663
Mr. Tajiwa is the vocalist of the band Original Love.

378
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:16,534
He used to sing the theme song of the TV show Banana Chips Love.

379
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,823
I'm not Tanaka Seiji.

380
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:21,436
That's right.

381
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,466
That's right.

382
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:27,345
Tony has been paying a lot of attention to it since he was abroad.

383
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,426
It was a cool song today.

384
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,002
Please give it up for them.

385
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:31,648
Thank you.

386
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:34,248
Okay, okay.

387
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:38,865
Well then, please look forward to tomorrow's Ugo Go Uta's album as well.

388
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:39,688
See you then!

389
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:40,812
Bye-bye!

390
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:46,082
Looking for men's treasures.

391
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,590
Lunch break.

392
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,920
There's one left.

393
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:52,422
A rampage.

394
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:59,779
Hello, would you like to introduce me to the Ugo Ugo Museum?

395
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:08,048
What's going on?

396
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:10,970
Comment ça va?

397
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,316
Comment ça va?

398
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,627
Comment allez-vous?

399
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,215
Comment allez-vous?

400
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:23,674
Let's go!

401
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:32,006
The first work is by Hamazaki Daihiko, 8 years old, from Chiba Prefecture.

402
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:32,668
There is a fox around the fox.

403
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,689
Good!

404
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,624
Let's move on to the next one.

The next artist is 9-year-old Noniko Kusanagi from Tokyo.

00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:03,406
The title is called, What are you doing, old man?

409
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,731
Old man!

410
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,474
Oya-jimushi!

411
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,822
What are you doing, Oya-jimushi?

412
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:08,685
I'm putting on make-up!

413
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:10,532
You're putting on make-up, huh?

414
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,395
That's pretty gross.

415
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:12,619
Oya-jimushi is popular!

416
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:14,586
Shall we move on to the next one?

417
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,309

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,265
Let's go to the next one.

420
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:25,707
Salmon!

421
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:31,512
Next is Marina's older sister, Elika Shirai, 6 years old.

422
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:33,942
The title is Baby's Painting.

423
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:37,967
It's a baby, isn't it?

424
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:39,638
It's cute, isn't it?

425
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,303
Shall we go next?

426
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:44,040

He's a robot.

430
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:49,163
Today, too,

431
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,152
You enjoyed the morning art, right?

432
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:53,341
Well then, it's time to go home.

433
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:55,309
See you later!

434
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,912
Bye bye!

435
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:57,238
Bye bye!

436
00:21:57,258 --> 00:21:57,419
Bye bye!

437
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,021
Bye bye!

438
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:58,242
Bye bye!

439
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,843
Well, Haruo Chikada seems to be disappointed that he couldn't use the joke he had been thinking about.

440
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:23,886
I'm Masayoshi, the owner of Uchidebi.

441
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm always here for you.

442
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:26,676
Thank you very much.

443
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:29,041
My sister was active before you were born.

444
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:33,841
Do you know that?

445
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,804
I don't know.

446
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:35,407
Really?

447
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,110
That's sad.

448
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,953
Please do your best.

449
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,845
Somebody!

450
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:42,794
Somebody!

451
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:43,298
Somebody!

452
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,642
How was the third day of the live broadcast?

453
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:52,022
It's a live broadcast only this week, so there are two more days left.

454
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:53,768
The staff of Go!

455
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:53,869
Go!

456
00:22:53,969 --> 00:23:00,713
GORUGA are not sleeping well, but please cheer for us tomorrow.

457
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:07,507
That was 30 minutes in a blink of an eye.

458
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,100
Ryuga-chan, you've seen a place you've never seen before, right?

459
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,694
Where is it?

460
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:13,763
Let's call them.

461
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,719
There might be people who know them.

462
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:16,626
Let's go!

463
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,364
Let's go.

464
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,635
Okay, that's all for today.

465
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:34,498
Who is this?

466
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,184
Ryuga-chan, who is this?

467
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:41,131
There's a rumor that it's Riga's grandpa.

468
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:41,733
Is that right?

469
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,074
Yes.

470
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,740
Is that right?

471
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,743
That's good.

472
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,509
It's grandpa, isn't it?

473
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,372
Grandpa, wave your hand.

474
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,572
I'm glad to hear that.

475
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,180
Thank you all for watching.

476
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,189
We'll see you next time.

477
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:57,058
Bye-bye!

478
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,491
Thank you.
