1
00:00:00,284 --> 00:00:03,615
Natsu no asa, mezamesha, oh!

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,742
Mada aru koneko-chan, bravo!

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:10,277
Furi-chin, nama-dashi, nama-nama, hajimari

4
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:24,214
It's been a while since the last live broadcast.

5
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,059
Let's do our best.

6
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:25,903
From today to Friday.

7
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:33,852
Last time, TV-kun went to the house of the people in front of the TV.

8
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:40,319
Hello, I'm here to talk to you.

9
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,142
I'm going to hell.

10
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:44,460
I don't know what's waiting for me to do.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,597
This is what it's like when I'm live.

12
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:48,482
Please support me.

13
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:50,188
Are you ready?

14
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:52,155
Okiraku goku raku!

15
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:55,929
Okiraku goku raku!

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,274
Well done!

17
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,327
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,075
The radio is amazing.

19
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,548
Can you hear the sun?

20
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:16,849
Yes!

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,182
The sun is shining.

22
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,253
How many days have you been here?

23
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,583
This is Shun-kun's Off-Lance course.

24
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:30,855
In the Off-Lance course, you can learn about the news.

25
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:33,191
Let's go!

26
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,286
Let's go right away!

27
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,373
Result Formation 1

28
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,756
Today's En Daka.

29
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:40,962
Shut up!

30
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,128
Sorry, that was a farce.

31
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:44,521
I'll take it off from the beginning.

32
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:44,963
I see.

33
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:45,908
Finally!

34
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:46,873
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:50,571
Finally, En has entered the 1 dollar 100 yen range.

36
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,485
He has recorded the highest price since the war.

37
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,652
How much is a wrestler's nose?

38
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:58,200
I don't know at all.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,450
How much is a day's allowance?

40
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,538
So, this is...

41
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,458
You're not giving it to me?

42
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,265
How much is it?

43
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:08,787
300 yen!

44
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:09,571
300 yen?

45
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,258
I'll buy the steering wheel.

46
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,503
That's good.

47
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,468
Today's Hoseokawa

48
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,688
It's not Kumin.

49
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,616
It's Prime Minister Hosokawa.

50
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,128
Do you know the new Prime Minister?

51
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,574
No, we don't.

52
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,041
Do you know Ugo?

53
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,972
Well, a week after the new cabinet was adopted, Prime Minister Kasogawa went to a human dock at a hospital in Tokyo yesterday.

54
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:38,914
I took a short summer vacation in Karuizawa for two nights and three days.

55
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:40,439
I often take a vacation like this.

56
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,764
Well, it's going to be hard from now on.

57
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,811
Mr. Shizuke in front of the summer.

58
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,658
He's wearing tennis shoes.

59
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,183
Shall we go?

60
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:47,826
Let's go.

61
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:48,067
Wow.

62
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,298
Because I was a cheerleader.

63
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:02,024
An unknown incident happened at the high school.

64
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:02,908
August 14th.

65
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,676
It's amazing, isn't it?

66
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:12,477
NHK's male staff came to cheer for Koshie with a 8mm video of Chia Girl.

67
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:16,171
The police said that the shooting was done from a low angle.

68
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,986
The police said that the shooting was done from a low angle.

69
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,847
Let's move on to the next one.

70
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,799
The next one is Yutan Rush Ska Ska.

71
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,908
This one is also amazing.

72
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:36,774
It's like NHK, where families and young people who spent their summer holidays in their hometowns and highlands spent their summer holidays.

73
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:39,223
From Sunday to yesterday, it was at its peak.

74
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:43,323
Yeah, but it looks like the traffic is getting less and less.

75
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:43,564
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,473
Ruka-chan, did you go somewhere the other day?

77
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:45,613
I did!

78
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:45,754
Where?

79
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:46,776
Nice.

80
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,782
How about you, Ugo-go?

81
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:52,052
Where are you from?

82
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:53,917
Where are you from?

83
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:54,118
Let's go.

84
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,221
Let's go.

85
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,372
Nousatsu model.

86
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:01,211
Do you know what nousatsu means?

87
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,477
It means to come.

88
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:06,664
On August 14th, there was a huge panic at the airport in Singapore.

89
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,261
The reason for this was the famous model of the magazine Playboy,

90
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:14,408
I don't know any of them.

91
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:18,931
It's a very exciting time for the two of them.

92
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,222
The 200 people are getting ready to go.

93
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,609
Let's move on to the next one.

94
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,549
The first victory of the transformation team, K.I.R.

95
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:39,282
The F1 championship was held on the 15th at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

96
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,225
It's amazing.

97
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,355
This is the record for the shortest time in the world.

98
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,449
Let's move on to the next one.

99
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:48,833
I'm looking forward to the next one.

100
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,631
Let's go to the next one.

101
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:58,857
Let's go!

102
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:00,770
That's right.

103
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:01,554
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:02,519
The last one is amazing.

105
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,850
Punch-kun is already in a bad mood.

106
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,564
He's not in a good mood.

107
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,477
It's been a week since the last live broadcast.

108
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,612
It's been a week since the last live broadcast.

109
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:12,880
It's been a week since the last live broadcast.

110
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,708
Let's see if we can get through this wave safely and get a lot of attention from all directions.

111
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:19,090
Where is it?

112
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,042
You're not young anymore?

113
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,188
Well, I wonder.

114
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,321
I'm looking forward to seeing Punch-kun.

115
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:26,149
Well, let's go home.

116
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,643
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

117
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:30,868
See you tomorrow!

118
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,854
What is this?

119
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:54,375
Today we have Yodai, Furuchofu, Nelton Piken, Asadake, Akahideka and Inoue.

120
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:03,470
Ugoru Tenki Oho!

121
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,222
Ame ni mo kaze ni mo make nai tsuyoi aite

122
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,254
Good morning!

123
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,281
It's time for Planet's weather forecast.

124
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,526
First, the weather in Naha.

125
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,630
Today's weather in Naha is sunny and cloudy.

126
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,701
Next, Fukuoka.

127
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,401
Fukuoka is a place where the rain and the thunder are in full swing.

128
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:23,212
It's better not to walk outside with your navel out.

129
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:23,753
Now, Kochi.

130
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,678
The weather in Kochi is cloudy and rainy.

131
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:26,380
Hiroshima.

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,343
It's raining in Hiroshima.

133
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:28,767
Where did the sun go?

134
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,849
In Osaka, it's cloudy and sometimes it's raining.

135
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,386
In Koshien, it's raining so much that you want to run away.

136
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,160
In Nagoya, it's cloudy and it rains from noon.

137
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,275
In Nagano, it's cloudy and it rains from time to time.

138
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,385
Now, we're in Tokyo where Ugo-go and Ryuga-chan are.

139
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,695
The weather in Tokyo is cloudy.

140
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:49,948
It rains once in the morning and once at night.

141
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:50,630
Will there be no more hot summer?

142
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,192
It's Niigata.

143
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:51,653
It rains in Niigata.

144
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:52,375
It's cloudy in Sendai as well.

145
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:59,665
The weather in Sapporo is sunny.

146
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:03,274
It's cloudy from noon.

147
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:04,947
The weather is gloomy all over the country today.

148
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:10,153
It's raining so much that we can't make plans for the summer vacation.

149
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:11,540
On the 25th of next week, there will be a concert at Oginome Yoko.

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,882
Please come!

151
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,050
I'm going to play with Toru-chan!

152
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,514
Shina's Shuto Special!

153
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:31,991
Oh, what a coincidence.

154
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:34,005
We're going to the camp too, poor thing.

155
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:39,962
I can't believe it!

156
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:46,831
Good morning.

157
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,159
I'm Yomiuri Betty's Takeda-san.

158
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:58,020
Today, I'm going to teach you how to be a leader.

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,322
I'm a leader!

160
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:06,540
When you shoot, you have to look at the ball well and aim for the side of the ball.

161
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:14,311
If you follow the rules, you will naturally be able to go in the right direction.

162
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,737
I would like to follow the rules with great care.

163
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:18,549
The way I practice is to go against the wall.

164
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,770
If I can go against the wall even if I'm alone, I think I can do it naturally.

165
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,526
I hope you can do well in shooting.

166
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:30,891
Even if you don't shoot well in the game,

167
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:36,426
Even if you make a mistake, you have to shoot with the feeling that you are scoring a point.

168
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,624
Don't forget to study literature.

169
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:42,822
Don't forget to study technology, basics, and your mental state.

170
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,711
I can shoot, so please shoot a good shot.

171
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:52,812
Please shoot with the feeling that you have definitely decided.

172
00:08:52,792 --> 00:09:02,413
Ah!

173
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:06,307
Oyajimishi!

174
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:08,378
Dodo Ryuga!

175
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,223
Sapporo no Rubik's Day!

176
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,199
I'm looking forward to it!

177
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:12,420
Stop it...

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,327
Hadakadetaku!

179
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,964
Good morning.

180
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:22,313
I'm Furuya Kizakawa.

181
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,688
This week, we'll be talking about dinosaurs.

182
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:33,075
The dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that appeared 2.3 billion years ago.

183
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:39,437
Some people think that all the reptiles that lived long ago were dinosaurs, but they're wrong.

184
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,933
The winged dragon that flies in the sky.

185
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,867
The long-necked dragon that swims in the water.

186
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:45,934
The fish dragon that looks like a fish.

187
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:50,827
These are not dinosaurs.

188
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:54,987
Dinosaurs are reptiles that walk with their legs straight down.

189
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,148
I see.

190
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:59,919
This is called direct fire.

191
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:00,362
That's what they say.

192
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:07,990
Dinosaur don't move their legs like a crocodile or a lizard.

193
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,631
It walks like a dog or a bird.

194
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:17,693
Now that I think about it, all the reptiles nowadays...

195
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:24,684
I think it's always good to stand up and walk.

196
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,974
See you tomorrow.

197
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:32,982
I don't know what to do with you!

198
00:10:55,473 --> 00:11:02,875
Oh, son.

199
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,036
Oh, oh.

200
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,998
It's a live broadcast, so it's not a mystery.

201
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:13,313
Actually, I heard a scary story from a friend on TV.

202
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:18,197
It's scary just to say it.

203
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,308
It's a morning meeting.

204
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:21,513
Are you two peeing?

205
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:22,257
Are you okay?

206
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:27,634
Today's friend is Yuji Yamashina from Tokyo and Edo.

207
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:28,500
Good morning, Yuji!

208
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,829
Good morning!

209
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,293
Good morning!

210
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:33,917
Is today's story scary?

211
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,492
It's scary.

212
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:40,072
It's scary just to hear that the stage is this one, isn't it?

213
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,781
Then, please.

214
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:47,535
I heard from a friend that there was a woman named Mijel.

215
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:51,049
This man picked up a taxi after a long time.

216
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,041
When he got on the Aoyan-buchi... Aoyan-buchi?

217
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,748
For some reason, he was flying.

218
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:56,310
Yes.

219
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,442
As a father, Mr. Atsuhiro woke up from the shock.

220
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:02,248
Yes, why?

221
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,471
What happened?

222
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,136
Oh, don't ask me that!

223
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:12,342
If you listen to it again, you won't be able to see it yet.

224
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,758
The train is about to stop.

225
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,305
The train is about to stop.

226
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:20,529
The train is about to stop.

227
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,254
The train is about to stop.

228
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,401
The train is about to stop.

229
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,183
The train is about to stop.

230
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:29,622
This is not a love story.

231
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:33,506
He said, it's not him.

232
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:38,886
Soon after he got out of the grave, the man's face was separated.

233
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:47,492
If you ask the driver, the man who was caught in the cemetery is looking for the culprit.

234
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,277
That's scary.

235
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:52,017
How about you, Luka?

236
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:52,238
Huh?

237
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:52,460
What?

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,863
It's funny.

239
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:53,668
It's not funny, is it?

240
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,898
It's very scary, isn't it?

241
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,022
Thank you very much.

242
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:02,044
I'm scared and I don't have time, so I can't hold it in anymore.

243
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:02,646
Can I end it now?

244
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,636
Thank you!

245
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:05,260
Thank you!

246
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,436
Oh, that was scary.

247
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:08,637
I got it!

248
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:12,653
Hit it!

249
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:13,885
Hit it!

250
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:28,600
What are you doing?

251
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,847
Good morning!

252
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:47,855
This week, I'm going to do a love cupid, so please look forward to it!

253
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,984
Today's first day of Naya Bell Otome is Ito Mari from Saitama prefecture!

254
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:51,887
Hello!

255
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:56,905
Good morning, Mari-chan!

256
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:57,366
Good morning!

257
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:58,029
Good morning.

258
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:58,510
What grade are you in?

259
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,036
I'm in 5th grade.

260
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,320
What kind of person are you in love with?

261
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:05,370
He's a sportsman.

262
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,782
Oh, really?

263
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,170
Are you in the same class?

264
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:11,436
Yes.

265
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,386
So, what should I call you?

266
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:14,440
O-kun.

267
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:15,847
Eh?

268
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:16,470
O-kun.

269
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,671
O-kun?

270
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:22,600
So, what do you think about O-kun?

271
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,022
I like him.

272
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,981
That's right!

273
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:27,423
Where is it?

274
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:28,408
I know where it is!

275
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:29,454
Mari-chan!

276
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:29,755
Yes?

277
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,107
I'll do my best to tell Toma and Oh-kun!

278
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:33,448
Yes.

279
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:34,712
Well then, Oh-kun!

280
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:36,599
Yes.

281
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,084
Oh-kun!

282
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:38,184
Yes.

283
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:38,766
Good morning!

284
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,960
Good morning.

285
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,572
Did you hear what I just said?

286
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,798
Yes, I did.

287
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,280
How was it?

288
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,409
How was it for you, Oh?

289
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:48,570
Well...

290
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:49,934
Peek-a-boo!

291
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,372
Eh?

292
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:56,235
Peek-a-boo!

293
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,315
Eh?

294
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:56,556
Peek-a-boo!

295
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:56,857
Peek-a-boo!

296
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:57,138
Peek-a-boo!

297
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:57,379
Peek-a-boo!

298
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:57,619
Peek-a-boo!

299
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:57,880
Peek-a-boo!

300
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,141
Peek-a-boo!

301
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:58,442
Peek-a-boo!

302
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,087
I mean, it's normal.

303
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,213
You're shy, aren't you?

304
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:04,795
I know!

305
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:10,153
You can't say that you like me!

306
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,894
O-kun, yoroshiku ne!

307
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,454
Mari-chan to nagayaku suru no yo!

308
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:15,756
Yoroshiku ne!

309
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:20,031
Now, let's sing a song for the two of them!

310
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:23,282
A song that everyone wants to hear!

311
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:29,847
You can give me your love, but it's a tragedy!

312
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,975
If it's for love, I won't give it to you.

313
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:32,698
It's a love of passion!

314
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:33,560
Let's do it!

315
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:39,472
Oku, do your best!

316
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:43,110
And everyone, bye bye!

317
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,689
See you tomorrow!

318
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,516
Let's do our best!

319
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:51,786
See you tomorrow!

320
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:52,408
Bye!

321
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,917
What the hell is this?

322
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,710
What?

323
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,156
What is it?

324
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,502
A pocket.

325
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,620
A musical.

326
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:28,011
I heard that you guys are doing a great job.

327
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,002
NHK seems to have a lot of things they like.

328
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:34,297
Thank you for the meal!

329
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,889
Thank you for the meal!

330
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,697
Thank you for the meal!

331
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:45,700
Kojiro, Ojo-chan, Gabi, Futsu, Oroda, Futsu, together makes 12.5 million yen!

332
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,423
Why don't you pay me 1,100 yen?

333
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,602
You say that too, Chiyaki

334
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:56,282
Oh-cha!

335
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:59,419
With a one-million-yen coin in my hand, let's go fishing!

336
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,122
Ya-ho-ho!

337
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:04,341
What are you going to do when you're dumb?

338
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,245
I'm going to do it!

339
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:05,747
I'm going to do it!

340
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:12,009
Well, well, well, I thought I'd get kicked out of Kiyomizu's stage today, so I'll give you 500 yen.

341
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,012
500 yen?

342
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:14,477
That's a lot of money today.

343
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:15,079
I'll give it to you.

344
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,982
You're such an idiot!

345
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:23,427
Nagaraku-kun, thank you so much for being with us.

346
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:28,241
Tomorrow will be even more fun, so please look forward to it.

347
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:30,267
Well then, everyone on Earth, goodbye!

348
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:35,953
Seira Oyajimu

349
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:40,078
I'm the bad guy, Osaka Robo.

350
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:41,663
I'm Tsukiyo's father.

351
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,689
Instead of Tsukiyo, I'm your father.

352
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,492
Don't call me your father!

353
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:46,735
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

354
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,302
Good morning, morning!

355
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,799
This is Tony the Summer Man's song album.

356
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:57,506
The first guest of this summer's live show is a passionate singer, Taichi Ofiteki-san.

357
00:17:57,526 --> 00:18:00,420
The singer is, of course, Big D!

358
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,540
Yeah!

359
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:16,234
While blowing on the wind, the sky is clear blue sky

360
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:23,828
Let's sing a song of joy

361
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:26,933
Oh, okay, okay.

362
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,573
Now you're something more.

363
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:42,257
Let's put our voices together and get ready for tomorrow.

364
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:43,723
Today is a good day.

365
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:52,212
One, two, three!

366
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,607
It's the best!

367
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:55,831
It's the best, isn't it?

368
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,657
Well then, Torii-kun's number 7, Godrash.

369
00:18:57,757 --> 00:19:02,151
Today's request is a passionate storm in My Flyer's Fideki.

370
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,965
I decided to sing My Friend on my own, but can I?

371
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,558
Hideki, can you sing a passionate song?

372
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,365
If you wish, Hideki!

373
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:14,622
Can I give you my life?

374
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:17,013
It's Hideki, not Shideki.

375
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,077
Okay, okay.

376
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:21,499
Hideki.

377
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,384
I see.

378
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:26,314
Thank you very much!

379
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:27,463
Please give him a big hand!

380
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:37,740
Please look forward to the song album of Tony, the summer man tomorrow as well.

381
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,870
There are a lot of guests who are looking forward to it.

382
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,427
See you tomorrow, boy!

383
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,748
Boy!

384
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,827
Ganbare!

385
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:03,816
Oh, no!

386
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:04,560
Oh, no!

387
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,997
You have to grow up soon.

388
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:08,318
I'm jealous.

389
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:18,415
It's time for the live broadcast of April!

390
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:18,898
Let's go!

391
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:27,303
And today, I'm going to hear the anger of the dissatisfied people all over the country!

392
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:28,667
The first dissatisfied person today is Hamamatsu's Saito Maki-chan!

393
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:28,888
Maki-chan!

394
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:32,138
How you doin'?

395
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:32,940
How you doin'?

396
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,863
How you doin'?

397
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:34,545
How you doin'?

398
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:35,107
How you doin'?

399
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:35,909
How you doin'?

400
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:36,972
How you doin'?

401
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:37,895
How you doin'?

402
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:38,577
How you doin'?

403
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:38,878
How you doin'?

404
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:43,890
Okay, Makise, go!

405
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:44,413
Fumanda!

406
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:52,283
I got a B in my first year of high school!

407
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:52,905
I see!

408
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:54,792
That's so frustrating!

409
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:57,917
I see!

410
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,398
But whose fault is that?

411
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,808
I don't know.

412
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,636
I see!

413
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,062
Good luck, Maki-chan!

414
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,408
See you!

415
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:09,709
Bye-bye!

416
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,939
Let's go!

417
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,426
Okay, let's go next!

418
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,977
It's Sayaka, the black-eyed girl from Okayama!

419
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:16,138
Sayaka!

420
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:19,949
Good morning!

421
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,613
Good morning!

422
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:24,421
Let's sing a song of dissatisfaction!

423
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,183
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

424
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:26,998
Good!

425
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:29,852
Sayaka-chan, you go first!

426
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:33,831
No matter how many times I practice, I can't sing Private Child's song.

427
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:33,992
Really?

428
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,821
That's hard, isn't it?

429
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:39,780
You know a lot of things, don't you?

430
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:40,725
Sing for us!

431
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,692
That's right!

432
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,066
You have to work hard and practice!

433
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,074
There's still a long way to go.

434
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,762
Yes!

435
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,770
You can do it!

436
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,031
Yes!

437
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:58,305
If you're still dissatisfied, keep saying it!

438
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:58,405
Yes!

439
00:21:58,425 --> 00:21:59,590
Well then, Sayaka-chan, bye bye!

440
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,132
Bye bye!

441
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,939
Bye-bye!

442
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,404
Alright, let's sing again!

443
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:06,215
Everyone in the studio, ready?

444
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:06,676
Way to go!

445
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,868
Way to go!

446
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,645
I don't want to!

447
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:31,705
Well, I heard that Shurikun mistakenly called NHK a national broadcast.

448
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:37,527
I wonder who it is!

449
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,550
Yeah, it's Tarasami!

450
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,074
Who is it?

451
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:43,905
It's Mawakoron Brothers!

452
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:54,845
Zoom in!

453
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:55,026
Zoom in!

454
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,278
How was the first day of the live broadcast?

455
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,646
For the time being, today has just begun.

456
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:03,717
Tomorrow morning, TV-kun will be at your home again.

457
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:06,602
Tenebi-kun will return to the studio!

458
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:16,694
Was it fun?

459
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:17,318
I think that was the most fun.

460
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,947
Which one was the most fun?

461
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:19,831
The song!

462
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:20,133
The song?

463
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:24,456
That's right, the real Saijo Hideki-san was really cool.

464
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:31,763
Hosokawa Fumie, Hayashi Atei, Paco, Magokoro Brothers, thank you so much for today!

465
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,738
There are a lot of interesting things tomorrow, right?

466
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:37,720
It's okay, right?

467
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:38,061
Bye!

468
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:39,325
See you tomorrow!

469
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:40,830
See you on the live broadcast!

470
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,010
Bye-bye!

471
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:50,505
Hello, hello, how are you all doing?

472
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,817
August 28th, Saturday... Eh?

473
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,245
A little more to this side?

474
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:54,325
Eh?

475
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:58,849
Good?

476
00:23:58,869 --> 00:23:59,050
OK!

477
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,995
August 28th at 8pm!
