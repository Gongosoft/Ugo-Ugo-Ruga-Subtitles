1
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:10,399
Welcome!

2
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:11,003
Welcome!

3
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:24,874
With gentle words, I brush my eyelashes

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:33,514
Even though I'm a man, I'm cold inside

5
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,773
¶¶

6
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,380
Konnichiwa!

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,404
Konnichiwa!

8
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:00,645
Konnichiwa!

9
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,552
This is a live broadcast!

10
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:04,218
You can do it if you try it twice a day, right?

11
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:04,358
Yes!

12
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,442
Did you have a good day?

13
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,091
I did!

14
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,157
Did you pee?

15
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:08,760
I did!

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,404
Okay, that's enough.

17
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,791
It's time for the evening words.

18
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,579
MUSEUM ON AIR!

19
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:16,457
MUSEUM ON AIR!

20
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,266
A museum is an art museum.

21
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,431
On air means broadcasting.

22
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:26,485
Right now, Ugo Goruga's studio is connected to the Futabashi-Kuritsubijutsukan in Tokyo.

23
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:31,817
Oh, yeah!

24
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:37,776
At this art gallery, the Media Epoch exhibition is being held.

25
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:40,184
You two can draw in this studio today.

26
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:41,368
It was interesting yesterday.

27
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:45,132
Everyone in front of the TV can participate.

28
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:47,950
We'll show you what kind of system it is.

29
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:59,290
First of all, if everyone in front of the TV went to the Utabashi-Kuritsubijutsukan, they would use a computer at the venue to draw, and that would be the museum's...

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,499
It will be an exhibition.

31
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,988
People who saw it yesterday will know, right?

32
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,478
I'm happy to see my painting in the museum.

33
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,706
I want to experience it.

34
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:15,888
Next, children who can't go to the museum can participate in PAX.

35
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,696
Please ask your parents for help.

36
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:26,273
When you send the fax, it will be delivered to the museum.

37
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,403
I wrote a lot of them.

38
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:33,225
The ones I wrote at the art museum, the ones I sent to the art museum by fax,

39
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:38,627
It will be shown live in the studio of Ugo Goruga.

40
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,000
And everyone can watch it on TV at home.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,165
It's new.

42
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:46,220
Drawing with a computer is very interesting, isn't it?

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,963
It moves, doesn't it?

44
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:47,184
Yes.

45
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,755
You learned it right away, didn't you?

46
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:50,117
Yes.

47
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:53,524
For those who want to go to the museum, I'll explain the location.

48
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,399
Here's the map.

49
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,261
It's located in Itabashi-ku, Tokyo.

50
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:02,217
Please get off at Takashimadaira Station on the Toei-Mita Line.

51
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:06,329
Nishiguchi's Takashimadaira library has been fined.

52
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:10,602
I'm sorry I told you something a little confusing on TV yesterday.

53
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:11,464
This method is convenient.

54
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:18,672
There is also a Soge bus from Narimatsu Station on the Tobu Tojo Line.

55
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,138
The art museum is open from 9 am to 4.30 pm.

56
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:24,375
Please take a good look at the map.

57
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:24,656
Okay.

58
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,021
You might want to send it by fax, right?

59
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,844
Yes.

60
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,390
I'll show you the number.

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,073
Here's the number.

62
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:29,374
0353835555.

63
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:37,890
0353835555.

64
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,238
Don't mess up your phone number.

65
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,506
It's not a phone call, so we can't talk to you.

66
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:42,727
Okay.

67
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:44,052
Draw your favorite picture and send it to me.

68
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,336
I'm under 12 years old.

69
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:45,838
Okay.

70
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:49,897
Today, TV-kun is going to the Itabashi Art Museum.

71
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,846
See you there!

72
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:59,823
I'm flying.

73
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:00,469
This is quite eye-catching.

74
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:18,507
This is the Itabashi-Kuritsu Art Museum.

75
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,380
I wonder if there are many people who watched yesterday's broadcast.

76
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:22,862
Hello.

77
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:23,183
I'm walking.

78
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:28,929
It would be nice if there were a lot of them.

79
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,155
There's a little one, too.

80
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,300
Hello, I'm Terebi-kun.

81
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:32,958
Hello!

82
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,173
In the studio, we will be drawing again today.

83
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,725
The teacher is Shuru-kun.

84
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:43,752
By the way, everyone at the venue, please say it with us, okay?

85
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,013
Okiraku!

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,943
Gokuraku!

87
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:46,285
Okiraku!

88
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:56,072
Hello, can you introduce me to the museum?

89
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,739
How are you?

90
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,202
I'm fine!

91
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,522
Next up is a live broadcast in the evening.

92
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,588
What do you do in the evening?

93
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,393
I'll draw a picture.

94
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:23,072
Okay, let's start with the wall painting.

95
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:26,407
This singer has gone to bed.

96
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:28,477
It's already the second day.

97
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:29,923
You can go to the stage now.

98
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,463
Let's get back to it.

99
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:38,023
Today, we're going to show them our faces.

100
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,427
It's your own face.

101
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,370
Your own face?

102
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,012
Your own face.

103
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:42,998
Please draw your own face.

104
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,225
I'm drawing it already, right?

105
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:45,947
Sure, draw it.

106
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,311
Let's do it quickly.

107
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:48,013
Let's do it quickly.

108
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:53,077
This is Gogo-kun, right?

109
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,006
Yes.

110
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:56,271
Ryuga-chan.

111
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:57,497
Oh, Ryuga-chan has also started.

112
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,011
Your face is a little too thin, isn't it?

113
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,358
Oh, that's right!

114
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,709
But it's okay because it's your ideal type.

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,692
Is it okay?

116
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:07,133
It's okay.

117
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:07,875
Please draw more and more.

118
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:12,921
While Uogoto Ruiwa is writing in the studio, Itabashi Kuritsu Museum.

119
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:17,032
There are children in the Itabashi art museum as well.

120
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,821
Tomoto-chan from the Itabashi art museum!

121
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,806
Hi, Shurikuu!

122
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:20,792
Bonjour!

123
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:21,859
Bonjour!

124
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,228
How are you?

125
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,818
I'm fine!

126
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:26,347
It's a tomato!

127
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,453
Ah, it's a tomato!

128
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,243
It's a small tomato today, isn't it?

129
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,108
That's right!

130
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:30,651
It's a small tomato today!

131
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,918
As usual, the eyes are sparkling and cute, right?

132
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:32,260
It's cute!

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,725
Right now, in this venue, four boys and four girls are drawing.

134
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,250
There are a lot of friends outside the venue.

135
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,353
And so, Pax is also getting bigger and bigger!

136
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,117
Ah, he's getting bigger.

137
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:47,278
Yes!

138
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:50,294
What do you think of the kids at the venue?

139
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,269
Oh, then let's see the 8th one, the boys.

140
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:54,556
The 8th one is a boy?

141
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:54,997
Yes!

142
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,528
Ah, what is this picture?

143
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:00,455
A caterpillar.

144
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:01,177
A caterpillar?

145
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:01,538
A caterpillar!

146
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,577
What's your name?

147
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,242
What's your name?

148
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:08,614
Oh, the other one is... Mario-mushi.

149
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,195
What's my name?

150
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,920
Are you Mario-mushi?

151
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,829
Nice!

152
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:14,496
Kawaii Daishi-kun!

153
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,099
Daishi-kun?

154
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,369
Hello, Daishi-kun.

155
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,213
Hello.

156
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:18,997
Hello.

157
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,061
What are you drawing?

158
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:20,202
Mario?

159
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:21,268
Show me.

160
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,174
Ah, I see.

161
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,141
Mario, right?

162
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,630
What about the other one?

163
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,333
What about the other one?

164
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:28,794
The old man?

165
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,360
Is there something about this?

166
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,347
What kind of caterpillar?

167
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:34,892
A normal caterpillar.

168
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,876
A normal caterpillar?

169
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:36,057
Yes.

170
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,205
Then, draw more and more caterpillars.

171
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:38,888
Yes.

172
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:39,390
Are you ready?

173
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:39,490
Yes.

174
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,785
I think I'll put in another one.

175
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,274
It's a girl on the third floor.

176
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:44,502
Well, this picture is...

177
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,165
What is this?

178
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,391
What is this?

179
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:48,219
It's a cat.

180
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:48,842
Oh, it's a cat.

181
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,875
Shure-kun, can you see it?

182
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,442
I can see it.

183
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:53,744
It's cute.

184
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,306
What's its name?

185
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,052
What's your name?

186
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,019
I'm Chiharu Furusawa.

187
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,380
Chiharu-chan.

188
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,483
How old are you?

189
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,108
I'm 12 years old.

190
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:04,790
12 years old?

191
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,034
You're good.

192
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,736
Now, the children are drawing as well.

193
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:09,882
Now, Tomoto-chan.

194
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:10,545
Yes?

195
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:12,656
Please show the children on the stage.

196
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,927
Yes.

197
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:16,581
Can you write your own name?

198
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:16,944
Yes!

199
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,990
Everyone, please write your own name!

200
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,437
It's a self-portrait.

201
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,583
It's a self-portrait!

202
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,678
You draw a self-portrait, and under it you write your name.

203
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:26,402
Okay.

204
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,749
Yes!

205
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,481
Please draw a self-portrait and write your name on it!

206
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:32,465
Tomoto-chan?

207
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:32,646
Yes!

208
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,916
What about the fax that's coming to the Itabashi Art Museum?

209
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:36,297
The fax?

210
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,681
There's a lot of them.

211
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,630
I'll show you a little bit.

212
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,014
The one that's flowing over there?

213
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:42,636
Yes.

214
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:45,145
How about the one at the venue?

215
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,149
Oh, the one that's playing?

216
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,373
The one I saw yesterday.

217
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:48,196
It's playing right now.

218
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,521
Can you see it?

219
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,745
Oh, they're coming.

220
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,884
It feels like they've been coming since before the broadcast started.

221
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:56,306
Really?

222
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:56,527
Yes.

223
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:56,929
I have a friend.

224
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,937
There's a tomato!

225
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,382
It seems like yesterday's wish has come true.

226
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:00,864
That's right!

227
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:02,229
There are a lot of tomatoes today!

228
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,313
There's a robot, too.

229
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:04,798
Send it to everyone.

230
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,565
Yes, please send it to everyone.

231
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,214
Well then, Takato-chan.

232
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:09,395
Yes!

233
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:12,210
I want to see the Ugo-Odoruga picture first, is that okay?

234
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,471
Yes!

235
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:14,260
Okay, then let's see the Ugo-Odoruga picture.

236
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,211
What's this?

237
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,253
Ugo Ugo-kun?

238
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:20,183
It's my face.

239
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,766
Uwago-kun, do you think your face is similar?

240
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:27,679
I think so!

241
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:28,384
You think so?

242
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,759
He doesn't have a nose.

243
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,045
Why are you drawing it?

244
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:36,730
How about you, Luka?

245
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:38,374
You look like him.

246
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:43,696
My eyes and mouth are connected!

247
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,699
Ugo-kun, let's try it again.

248
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,404
Ugo-kun, there's a problem.

249
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:48,330
My eyes and mouth are connected!

250
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,355
Everyone is drawing.

251
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,094
Let's go to the commercial.

252
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,827
Let's go!

253
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,741
It's about time for the kids to come down.

254
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:16,840
This is a cute house!

255
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,041
Hello!

256
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:18,045
Hello!

257
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:18,426
Hello!

258
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:18,587
Hello!

259
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21,898
Can you hear me?

260
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,644
Hello.

261
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,116
What's your name?

262
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,185
I'm Eiko Kumisaka.

263
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:28,864
Oh, she has a pretty good taste in her eyes.

264
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:29,568
MisaSaka-chan?

265
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,573
Eiko-chan?

266
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,122
Shall we look at the picture?

267
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:32,222
Yes.

268
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,952
Tenko-chan's name is in the alphabet, right?

269
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,233
It's similar!

270
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,316
It's similar!

271
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,281
Viva!

272
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,003
It's similar.

273
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:42,685
Look at her face.

274
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,167
Then, Shuri-kun, one more person.

275
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,215
The second one is a picture of a boy.

276
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:56,320
Ah!

277
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,439
You did a great job!

278
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,243
Yuta Nakao!

279
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,031
Yuta-kun!

280
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:02,935
Look at Yuta-kun's face!

281
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:08,149
Yuta, do you think you look like him?

282
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,584
Shigeta-kun, what do you think?

283
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,771
Do you think you look like him?

284
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,937
I don't think I look like him.

285
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,164
I don't think you look like him.

286
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:16,788
I don't think I look like him.

287
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:17,532
Which one is more manly?

288
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:29,648
Where did Mita come from?

289
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:33,394
We're in Tokyo.

290
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:36,712
So, did you watch yesterday's show?

291
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:36,832
Yeah.

292
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:38,119
Oh, you came to see the show.

293
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:41,377
Are you okay?

294
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:45,595
Yuta-kun, you're in a daze.

295
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:47,160
Yuta-kun, you were really energetic until just now.

296
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,501
Really?

297
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:49,206
Maybe you're shocked by your own rotation.

298
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,289
Is that so?

299
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:50,770
It's okay.

300
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,653
Then how about number 6?

301
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,481
Number 6!

302
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:57,258
Number 6 is pretty good, isn't he?

303
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,986
Yeah, he's pretty good!

304
00:11:59,006 --> 00:11:59,850
May I ask your name?

305
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,613
What's your name?

306
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:09,161
What do you think, Yuuki-kun?

307
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:09,583
It's similar.

308
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,228
Yuuki-kun is similar.

309
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:12,814
What do you think?

310
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,893
Do you think you look like him?

311
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:17,396
I don't think so.

312
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,605
I don't think you look like him.

313
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:19,786
Really?

314
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:20,871
I think you look like him a lot.

315
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,618
Do you think you look cooler than him?

316
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:23,720
Really?

317
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:27,703
Then try drawing a cool picture of yourself.

318
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:29,091
I'm looking forward to it.

319
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:29,272
Yes.

320
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:30,398
Then let's go with number 8.

321
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,653
Daishi-kun is really good!

322
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:37,933
Daishi-kun is really similar!

323
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:39,460
Daishi-kun?

324
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,330
This is Daishi-kun's face.

325
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:45,399
What do you think?

326
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:46,987
Daishi-kun!

327
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:47,087
Yes!

328
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,883
Daichi-kun, you look like him.

329
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,672
You look like him!

330
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:54,327
Maybe it would be better if you had a little more bulge.

331
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,501
If you do that, you might get it.

332
00:12:58,522 --> 00:12:58,943
You're good.

333
00:12:58,963 --> 00:12:59,786
It's like a dynamite.

334
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,753
Is it like a dynamite?

335
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:01,853
Yes.

336
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:06,149
How about number 7?

337
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,113
Number 7?

338
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:08,618
Noriko-chan.

339
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,120
Noriko-chan.

340
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:09,662
Noriko-chan.

341
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,425
Hello.

342
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,304
Did you hear Silk's voice?

343
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,016
Hello, Noriko-chan.

344
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:15,943
Noriko-chan, how is it?

345
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:16,990
Did you write it?

346
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:18,070
Oya?

347
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,362
That's right.

348
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,935
Mariko-chan, is this similar?

349
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:23,478
What do you think?

350
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:24,885
It's not very similar.

351
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:25,528
It's not similar?

352
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,661
Dorito-chan, we don't have much time.

353
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:29,586
We still have time.

354
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:30,953
You can keep writing.

355
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:32,160
Please keep writing.

356
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,929
Let's go with number 3.

357
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:36,014
Number 3!

358
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:39,669
This is Chiharu Chiharu.

359
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,256
She's cute.

360
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:48,040
It looks like him!

361
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,372
Chiharu-chan, have you been practicing this?

362
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,416
No, I haven't been practicing.

363
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:54,682
You haven't?

364
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:54,783
Yes.

365
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:55,385
You're really good.

366
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:58,198
What do you want to be in the future?

367
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,326
I haven't thought about it yet.

368
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:02,990
You haven't thought about it?

369
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,373
That's good.

370
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:03,936
You've been told off.

371
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:08,782
The first one is good.

372
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:10,973
I like it.

373
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:13,732
Ahaha, I love tomatoes!

374
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:14,779
That's nice.

375
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,209
It's Yuko-chan, isn't it?

376
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,115
Yuko-chan?

377
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,559
Yuko-chan, you're good.

378
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,051
You're good at being bad.

379
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,077
But being bad is good.

380
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:24,841
You have a good taste.

381
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,127
Let's look at your face.

382
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,367
Do you think you look like him?

383
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,563
I don't think it's similar.

384
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,529
Oh, but it has a taste.

385
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,913
It has a taste, doesn't it?

386
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:36,394
That's right.

387
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,199
It's better to add color.

388
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:39,222
Then continue to draw.

389
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,147
Please.

390
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,217
Then, number 4.

391
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,202
Number 4's friend.

392
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,072
Yes.

393
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:45,615
Ah, it's done.

394
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,102
It's done.

395
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:50,118
Oh, yeah!

396
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:50,580
Oh, yeah!

397
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,691
Oh, yeah!

398
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:53,133
Oh, yeah!

399
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:53,515
Oh, yeah!

400
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:55,390
Harashima Yashitaka.

401
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:56,394
Yashitaka-kun?

402
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,105
Yashitaka-kun is pretty cool.

403
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,475
He's popular.

404
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:02,158
He's cool.

405
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,560
Nice.

406
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:07,970
Yashitaka-kun, you're popular, aren't you?

407
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,377
I'm a fan of Tomotomo's Yashitaka-kun.

408
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:13,053
Did you really become a fan of Otomo-chan?

409
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:13,716
Yes!

410
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,182
Then, let's go back to the studio.

411
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:15,303
Yes!

412
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,713
Uomo-kun, show me!

413
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:21,831
What is this?

414
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,097
It's so funny!

415
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,432
What do you think of your face?

416
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,109
It doesn't look like me!

417
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:29,779
How about you, Ryuga?

418
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,891
What do you think of yourself?

419
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:40,326
What do you think of yourself?

420
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,993
Are you sleepy?

421
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:46,492
Should I shave your cheek more?

422
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:47,356
But it's similar, isn't it?

423
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:47,717
It's cute.

424
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,279
Isn't that a smart touch?

425
00:15:51,865 --> 00:16:01,875
Tomato-chan, it seems that everyone has drawn a picture, so please record this picture and ask everyone to draw a picture of you.

426
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:05,086
Everyone, please draw it cutely!

427
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,632
Try drawing Tomo-chan's face.

428
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:09,743
Make it beautiful!

429
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,730
Uo and Uga, please draw Tomo-chan's face.

430
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:17,285
Hurry up and draw it!

431
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,419
I don't think I can draw it.

432
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:20,580
No, no!

433
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:20,760
Why not?

434
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,464
You don't think you can draw it?

435
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:22,227
How do you draw it?

436
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,790
Don't you want to draw Tei-chan?

437
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:27,457
Please draw with your true feelings, Ugo-kun!

438
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:28,082
I'm going to draw her.

439
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:31,126
Well then, Shurikkun.

440
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:31,650
Yes?

441
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,162
Well then, let's do a fax.

442
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:38,071
There's a lot of people here, so I'd like to introduce you to some of them.

443
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:38,514
Is that okay?

444
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:38,896
Yes, please.

445
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:39,962
So, are you showing us the whole thing?

446
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:43,500
Well then, here comes the tomato movie!

447
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:46,375
Sato Kazuki-chan, 5 years old!

448
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,030
And Kazuki-chan is 5 years old.

449
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,160
Isn't she cute?

450
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,129
She's cute, isn't she?

451
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,218
Then, let's see the picture of the pig.

452
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:56,837
筋肉豚くん、くまんより上手!

453
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:02,220
Underneath that, there's a thing called a shurikoyajimushi.

454
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,139
I'm scared!

455
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,421
I'm scared!

456
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,104
I'm scared!

457
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:07,426
I'm scared!

458
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:07,767
I'm scared!

459
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,913
I'm scared!

460
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:09,637
I'm scared!

461
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:10,119
I'm scared!

462
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,742
I'm scared!

463
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:17,221
Also, if you turn right, you can see Tomato-chan.

464
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:18,548
Do you want to see more of Shu-kun?

465
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,753
There's also a TV.

466
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:23,913
Yes, it looks like this.

467
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:24,073
Yes.

468
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:24,675
How is it moving?

469
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,801
Is it moving?

470
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:27,082
Yes.

471
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:27,724
Show us, Goma.

472
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,689
I can only see the skin.

473
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:30,030
Please show us.

474
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:31,410
Good.

475
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,118
Ego-kun, write something.

476
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,242
With all your heart.

477
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,465
With all my heart.

478
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:37,428
That's right.

479
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:40,678
Ruka-chan, do you want to do it?

480
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,026
Luka-chan is also done.

481
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:48,745
It looks like everyone is drawing, so let's go to the commercial.

482
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,322
See you in the next video!

483
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,854
It looks like it's almost done.

484
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:02,599
This is it, right?

485
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:05,555
Ryuga-chan, you're drawing seriously.

486
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,860
Can you see Ryuga-chan's face?

487
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,656
You look serious.

488
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:14,011
It's been a while since I've seen you like that.

489
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,442
You always joke around, but you look serious today.

490
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,310
How about you, Uo?

491
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,853
I lost my love for you.

492
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:22,014
Why?

493
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:22,476
Huh?

494
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:22,597
Why?

495
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:23,421
I thought you were weird.

496
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:23,783
Why?

497
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,411
You couldn't express your love for me?

498
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:25,532
Yeah.

499
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,190
How about you, Ryuga-chan?

500
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:31,765
What is this?

501
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:32,569
Are you showing off?

502
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,332
Tears?

503
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,021
Yes, tears.

504
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,885
There are a lot of tears.

505
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:39,403
Now, Tobado-chan.

506
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,486
How do you like the venue?

507
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,055
It's getting better and better, and it's fun!

508
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:48,330
First of all, Chiharu-chan, the third girl, has become like this!

509
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:52,602
Shiobu-chan?

510
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:52,724
Yes?

511
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:53,612
You're good.

512
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:55,863
It's cute!

513
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,248
It's cute, isn't it?

514
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,095
It's not a crying tomato, is it?

515
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,565
Are you not crying?

516
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:02,388
You're not crying, are you?

517
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,332
Yes.

518
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,972
It's a strong tomato!

519
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,048
It looks like everyone else is still drawing.

520
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:08,371
Yes!

521
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:09,036
How about Fax?

522
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:18,486
Ah, Robot-kun.

523
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:22,637
If you go to the right, you can see the TV from Chinami-chan in Gifu prefecture.

524
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:23,640
It's cute, isn't it?

525
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,172
On the right side, there is also an angry tomato.

526
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:32,913
And then... Wow, this is good.

527
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:33,977
Is it?

528
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:34,700
Shurikun Nagai.

529
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:34,982
And then?

530
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:37,734
Shikato Shurikun, do you know him?

531
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:38,095
Shikato...

532
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,565
It looks like Han-chan.

533
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,541
There's a long Shuru.

534
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,807
It's a Shuru.

535
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:48,042
Hasuyama Satoshi-kun.

536
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:52,270
On the right, there's a picture of Go Go Go.

537
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:55,842
Ayano-chan is 4 years old!

538
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,685
Ugogo-kun?

539
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:56,986
Ugogo-kun?

540
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:58,471
Give it to me!

541
00:19:58,973 --> 00:19:59,374
Ugogo-kun?

542
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:01,060
Ugogo-kun sent me a picture of you.

543
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,602
What do you think?

544
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,255
Is it good?

545
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:04,637
Really?

546
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,020
Do you think it's similar?

547
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,467
Do you think it's similar?

548
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:09,149
Are you happy?

549
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:09,931
What should I do?

550
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:11,997
Then it seems that number 5 has played it.

551
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:22,088
The 5th one is written as Hidaki!

552
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:25,920
I want to see it.

553
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,049
I want to see it.

554
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:29,891
It's Shizuki!

555
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,357
That's cute.

556
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:32,040
It's done!

557
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,196
It's Shizuki, but it's Shizuki.

558
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:38,083
Shizuki?

559
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:38,625
It's done.

560
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,633
Let's go with the first one.

561
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:43,080
The first one is cute too!

562
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,552
Please show us!

563
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,898
The color is nice.

564
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,340
How is it?

565
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,264
She didn't use red.

566
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,670
But it's a nice color, isn't it?

567
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,363
Yuko-chan, you're good at this.

568
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:59,112
Yuko-chan, do you like tomatoes?

569
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,393
Let's go to number 8.

570
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:02,215
Number 8's friend.

571
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:05,404
Number 1 is drawing his own ship.

572
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:06,226
Very nice.

573
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:08,031
Daishi-kun.

574
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,355
Number 8's Daishi-kun.

575
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,957
What kind of image is that?

576
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:13,320
What do you mean?

577
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,147
What kind of image is that?

578
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,055
Say the truth!

579
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,143
Daishi-kun is pretty good.

580
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:19,946
Daishi-kun?

581
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:22,175
I can't say the truth.

582
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:22,416
Daishi-kun?

583
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:24,628
Daishi-kun, can you hear me?

584
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,256
Yeah, I can hear you.

585
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,347
Daishi-kun, you have a pretty good attitude.

586
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,453
You're going to be a big star in the future.

587
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:33,201
You're going to be a big hit in the future.

588
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:34,989
You're doing your best, aren't you?

589
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,190
Yes.

590
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,477
You're chewing gum, aren't you?

591
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:36,738
That's good.

592
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:37,260
That's a good attitude.

593
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:37,823
How is it?

594
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,923
How about number 6?

595
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,148
Number 6 looks like a friend.

596
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,178
Number 6 looks like a friend.

597
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:44,303
Number 6 looks like a friend.

598
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:45,327
Number 6 looks like a friend.

599
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:45,990
Number 6 looks like a friend.

600
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,814
Yuuki-kun!

601
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,202
Yuuki-kun, show me your tomato!

602
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:51,137
Show me your tomato?

603
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:55,696
But I like Yuki-kun a lot.

604
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:56,579
Yuki-kun's art.

605
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,748
Yuki-kun probably really likes Tomato.

606
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:03,511
Tokada-chan, I'd like to say goodbye to everyone at the venue.

607
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,013
I understand!

608
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,250
Everyone, thank you so much!

609
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,074
Thank you!

610
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:09,184
We're going back to the studio.

611
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:10,611
Thank you, Toba!

612
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,406
This is a picture of the studio.

613
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:19,053
This is a picture of the studio.

614
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:19,876
This is a picture of the studio.

615
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:20,719
There is a heart on it.

616
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,812
How about Ruka-chan?

617
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,218
Ruka-chan?

618
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:28,921
What?

619
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,266
She's crying.

620
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:33,358
As expected of the bold Ruka-chan.

621
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,413
Let's go back, Shuru.

622
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:39,282
Let's do it again tomorrow.

623
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:41,498
I'm going to go home now!

624
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:43,855
Bye-bye!

625
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:52,299
How was the live broadcast of the museum on air?

626
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,368
Children will quickly remember the drawing of the computer.

627
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:59,059
Itabashi Kuritsubijutsukan will be broadcast at 4 pm.

628
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,948
How was the museum on-air?

629
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:04,344
Children will quickly learn how to draw on a computer.

630
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:08,121
Itabashi-Kuritsubijutsukan is open until 4.30 pm.

631
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:12,419
Today is the end, so please expect it tomorrow.

632
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,267
It's okay to participate in FACTS.

633
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:15,833
I'll give you the number.

634
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:22,920
Yes, 0353835555, 53835555.

635
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,162
Got it?

636
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,869
Well then, TV-kun will go back to the studio.

637
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:36,353
Today, the two of them looked at the audience closely.

638
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,622
Everyone at the venue was very good.

639
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,589
Thank you very much.

640
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:46,191
I want you to gather a lot of people who want to draw on the computer.

641
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:49,166
Luka-chan, it's fun, isn't it?

642
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:51,517
Let's practice a little more.

643
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:52,080
Please do your best.

644
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,135
Tomorrow, too, the Newsy Amoyama live broadcast.

645
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:58,124
Please join us at Itagashi Kuritsubizu-kan!

646
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:01,494
That's right, there's an announcement, right?

647
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:01,935
Yes!

648
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:02,216
Yes!

649
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:04,062
Please watch the live broadcast tomorrow!

650
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:04,945
See you!

651
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:05,125
Bye-bye!

652
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,104
Let's go!
